Same as in Divine Journey 1. Requires an Induction Smelter!

![Preview Image](images/eye_of_ender_recipe.png)

Who doesn't LOVE nested crafting?!

![Preview Image](images/more_glowstone_in_the_nether.png)

This is the main (and most difficult) component of the Blood Altar. Aaaaand this is how you get it...!

![Preview Image](images/dread_crystal_recipe_tree.png)

![Preview Image](images/5x5_recipes.png)

The goal of the pack is to open the Bag that starts in your inventory that contains "The Meaning of Life". Of course, since you'll need a Key to Infinity, you'll need to first beat the pack for it.

![Preview Image](images/bag_of_truth.png)

Plates are required for a lot of recipes. Later you'll be able to easily automate them with a Compressor.

Slightly more involved...! This will probably be a priority to autocraft. ;)
