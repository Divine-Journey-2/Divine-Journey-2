You just need to craft a couple things.

Most of it is actually baseline Mekanism. The idea is to convert Mekanism HDPE Pallets into Plastic.

![Preview Image](images/mekanism_plastic.png)

Same as in Divine Journey 1. Requires an Induction Smelter!

![Preview Image](images/eye_of_ender_recipe.png)

Who doesn't LOVE nested crafting?!

Many of the early Tech mods and many of the midgame important recipes take a lot of Glowstone (as seen below), so a lot more has been added to the Nether.

![Preview Image](images/more_glowstone_in_the_nether.png)

This is the main (and most difficult) component of the Blood Altar. Aaaaand this is how you get it...!

![Preview Image](images/dread_crystal_recipe_tree.png)

Each Botania Flower has its own Petal, crafted in the Petal Apothecary, then the Flower is put together in the Roots Fey Crafter.

![Preview Image](images/galacticraft_7x7s.png)

![Preview Image](images/5x5_recipes.png)

![Preview Image](images/apalachia_dungeon.png)

The goal of the pack is to open the Bag that starts in your inventory that contains "The Meaning of Life". Of course, since you'll need a Key to Infinity, you'll need to first beat the pack for it.

![Preview Image](images/bag_of_truth.png)

Plates are required for a lot of recipes. Later you'll be able to easily automate them with a Compressor.

![Preview Image](images/laser_focus.png)

Slightly more involved...! This will probably be a priority to autocraft. ;)
