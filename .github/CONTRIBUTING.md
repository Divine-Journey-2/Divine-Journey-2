# How to contribute

The primary way to contribute to the development of Divine Journey 2 is via opening issues on the issue tracker. To contribute to the code instead, fork the repository, make a branch for your changes, and open a Pull Request to merge that branch with Divine-Journey-2/main.
Thank you for your willingness to contribute!
 
## Reporting an Issue

Before submitting an issue:
First, check if your issue topic has been submitted before. To check, simply search for some of the keywords that you would use. If it has, please don't submit a duplicate issue. If you have more information to add, comment on the prior issue. You may want to check the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rH9pyS7) to make sure you are not missing anything.
Then, check if you're on the latest Divine Journey 2 version. If not, please update and confirm the bug, typo, request, or other issue has not been fixed or implemented.
Finally, fill out the entire form. While some sections may appear to be duplicates, having the full picture of what caused a bug can significantly help in fixing it. Some Issue Templates may contain specific instructions, such as "Make sure the bug appears without Optifine" or "New Mods are unlikely to be added".

### Reopening a Resolved Issue

If the issue is marked as resolved, before commenting for it to be reopened:
First, check if you are on the latest DJ2 version. 
Then, check that it is not a change that is on Github and has merely not been published to Curseforge yet.
Finally, comment that it is unresolved, including the DJ2 version number and steps to reproduce if different from the already listed steps.


## Opening a Pull Request

To open a Pull Request (PR), you probably want to understand a bit about what is going on. If this is your first time working with Git, this may seem complex. If you want help or guidance, the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rH9pyS7) is likely the best place.
To begin with, you will want to [Fork the Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) via the Fork button in the top right of the Divine-Journey-2 Github.
Then, you want to create a new branch - either through [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) directly, or through the [Github Website](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository), or some other tool, such as [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol).
Next, you'll want to make your changes to the code, and Commit your changes to the branch (name your Commit something related to what you are doing - eg "Tweak plank recipe" or "Fix typo on Ignition tooltip". You then want to Push the branch from your computer out to where it can be accessed by Github.
Once you have made the changes you want, open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to merge your changes from your Branch on your Fork to Divine-Journey-2/main.
Now that the PR is opened, other people may review your changes. Some may leave comments or Request Changes. Once approved by Atricos, it will be merged into Main, and will be part of the next release!
