(This has to only be done once in multiplayer, by an admin.)

Version 2.12.0

- Updated Forge version from 14.23.5.2855 to 14.23.5.2860.

Mod updates:

- AE2 Unofficial Extended Life v50 -> v51d
- Bibliocraft 2.4.5 -> 2.4.6 (fixes the Desk Bell server bug)
- CraftTweaker 4.1.20.673 -> 4.1.20.674

Additions:

- Completely reworked the Mob Loot Fabricator (implemented by WaitingIdly). It's now available in Chapter 23 instead of 26 and it's much cheaper to build. The player can now choose to generate items from 18 different categories by inserting a "catalyst" item into its input slot. Instead of costing Mana, it now costs Life Essence to run. However one of the categories also generates Life Essence liquid back. It can also generate EvilCraft Blood, Vengeance Essence, Will, Gaia Spirits, DivineRPG Souls and boss drops, all Thaumcraft Vis Crystals, all Twilight Forest boss trophies, and more! Moved its quest to Chapter 23, explained the details there, and rearranged the Chapter.
- Underground Biomes Mossy Cobblestones can now be made from regular Cobblestones by Fluid Tranposing Water or infusing them with Bio Fuel; similarly to regular Mossy Cobblestone.
- Several enchantment descriptions have been suggested by ahuman and added by WaitingIdly.

Balance changes:

- The Immersive Engineering Coal Vein now generates 10% Diamond Ore up from 3%.
- The Immersive Engineering Quartzite Vein now generates 10% Black Quartz Ore too.
- The Eden Temple Sunstorm boss now has twice as much health and deal 50% more damage.
- The Alapachia "Find the button"-style dungeon is now about twice as rare.

Fixes:

- Added the Aether Skyroot Plank to the plankWood OreDict.

Miscellaneous:

- Corrected the Farming Station tooltip typo (the word "crops" was doubled).
