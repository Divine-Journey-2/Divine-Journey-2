dj2.introduction.book.name=Welcome
dj2.introduction.book.desc0=§4§n§lWelcome to Divine Journey 2!§r
dj2.introduction.book.desc1=§8§6You are a Fallen Angel that has one purpose in this world: Find the Meaning of Life! Fortunately however, it's already in your inventory, locked up in a convenient bag... So there isn't too much to do, huh...?
dj2.introduction.book.desc2=Hold on, you seem to need a key to open the bag, a Key to Infinity! Well that makes things a bit more complicated... Actually, WAY more complicated! So much so, that you'll have to beat an entire expert mode pack to find out what your bag contains!
dj2.introduction.book.desc3=In Divine Journey 2, you need to progress through all the available mods in order, since recipes are highly gated. A bunch of the recipes are also much more challenging, so you need a large amount of automation to obtain all materials necessary; and
dj2.introduction.book.desc4=you've been given the tools to set up all the automation your heart desires.
dj2.introduction.book.desc5=To succeed in this pack, you need to have a good understanding of Modded Minecraft in general, or at least have played some other modpacks that
dj2.introduction.book.desc6=give you a feel on how to autocraft, autoprocess, automate every aspect of any tech or magic mod, and so on.
dj2.introduction.book.desc7=Don't be discouraged however, since along the way, you'll be exploring wondrous dimensions added by DivineRPG, Twilight Forest,
dj2.introduction.book.desc8=Aether, Atum 2, AbyssalCraft, The Erebus, Galacticraft, and more. There is plenty of fun to be had with those, especially since you'll have access to them quite early on.
dj2.introduction.book.desc9=The main progression line consists of the following:
dj2.introduction.book.desc10=§l1.§r Early Exploration with Tinkers' Tools and Totemic / Roots spells and gadgets.
dj2.introduction.book.desc11=§l2.§r Tech Mods for all your automation needs.
dj2.introduction.book.desc12=§l3.§r Magic Mods: Blood Magic, EvilCraft, AbyssalCraft, Botania, Thaumcraft, Thaumic Augmentation, Bewitchment, and
dj2.introduction.book.desc13=Astral Sorcery.
dj2.introduction.book.desc14=§l4.§r Lategame OPness: Mystical Agriculture, RFTools Dimensions, Draconic Evolution, Alchemistry, ProjectE, and Avaritia.
dj2.introduction.book.desc15=§nNote:§r This pack is different from Divine Journey 1 in many aspects. If you want to play a port of Divine Journey 1
dj2.introduction.book.desc16=in 1.12.2, I highly suggest checking out Celestial Journey by Unhook.
dj2.introduction.book.desc17=This pack however, expands the mods offered by Divine Journey 1, makes quality of life changes such as way less grinding and waiting for recipes to complete in the
dj2.introduction.book.desc18=lategame, much fewer recipes that involve instability (like Thaumcraft Infusion), and much less grind in general. For example, you no longer have to setup the Demon Invasion a trillion times, you no longer need to defeat every Witchery (or Bewitchment) boss
dj2.introduction.book.desc19=a quadrillion times, and quest rewards tend to be a bit more generous this time.
dj2.introduction.book.desc20=Now go ahead, §lpress K to open your quests§r, and I hope you'll have fun in Divine Journey 2!
