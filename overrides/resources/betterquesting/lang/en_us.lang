dj2.quest.db.10.title=Wonderful magical Stones for sale!
dj2.quest.db.10.desc=It's easy to make money off of them, since this Flower simply generates them... You just need some regular Stone, which I'm sure you have PLENTY of, then place this Flower and boom! Nearby Stone is turned into Metamorphic Stone... Which, I'm sure you can use for SOMETHING!
dj2.quest.db.11.title=Hungry yet?
dj2.quest.db.11.desc=Craft a Gourmaryllis Flower! This is a hungry-hungry Flower that generates Mana from any type of food.

dj2.quest.db.16.desc=Craft some Elementium Tools.%n%nNote: You don't necessarily need to hurry with this quest. Bound tools might even be stronger. However, these will be required for lategame Tools such as Wyvern and Draconic Tools.
dj2.quest.db.17.title=Wait, there is more...
dj2.quest.db.17.desc=Insert typical bossfight quotes like %n%n"What you have defeated was a pure vessel of me!"%n%nor%n%n"You mortals cannot take my life so easily!"%n%nor%n%n"It's over Anakin, I have the high ground!

dj2.quest.db.19.title=Is your Pool cool?
dj2.quest.db.19.desc=No? Well, you can cool your Pool with this... your Mana Pool, that is. What does that do? Well, it makes it so items transform into different things... Uh, it's weird I know.
dj2.quest.db.20.title=Dark cover? Must be a thriller!
dj2.quest.db.20.desc=Use any 4 Engraved Coins to upgrade your Necronomicon to the Omothol version!
dj2.quest.db.21.title=The writing's on the wall

dj2.quest.db.22.title=Compressed Obsidian's got nothin' on this!
dj2.quest.db.22.desc=Mine up some Ethaxium! ... Which to be fair, is easier said than done. Why? Weeeelll, you'll find out.%n%nReminder: you might want to use your Blood Magic Bound Pickaxe. That's the only tool at this point that can mine it up.
dj2.quest.db.23.title=Tear it off!
dj2.quest.db.23.desc=Use your previous Staff of Rending and collect some Omothol Ghoul Flesh to craft a Skin of Omothol!
dj2.quest.db.24.title=From the depths... Rise!

dj2.quest.db.28.title=Does it enjoy a tasty soufflé?

Every 4 seconds it consumes a slice of Cake somewhere in an 11x11x11 cube centered around the Flower, so if you can produce Cakes faster than 1 every 32 seconds, then this is the Flower for you!%n%nSetting up multiple of them is an even better idea.

The Portal uses no Mana to stay lit, a quarter of a Mana Pool to open (split between the 2 Pools beneath the Natura Pylons), and very little Mana per trade.%n%nOnce opened, the first thing you should do is trade your current Lexica Botania with the elves to obtain Elven Knowledge!
dj2.quest.db.32.title=Tastes like Marzipan if you had Diamond teeth
dj2.quest.db.32.desc=Craft a couple Terrasteel ingots! One takes half a pool of Mana supplied to the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate to create.

dj2.quest.db.38.title=Sidebars!
dj2.quest.db.38.desc=The Handy Bag (Large) can store items based on its card size in each of its slots, which are increased from the Handy Bag's 27 to 55.%nOtherwise, functions the same as the Handy Bag, requiring a memory card to function and being able to hold 4 memory cards.

dj2.quest.db.45.title=It ain't Steel yo
dj2.quest.db.45.desc=Alloy up some Modularium! This is the basis for all Modular Machinery blocks. You won't need to set up any Modular Machines quite yet, though.
dj2.quest.db.46.title=Wanna be a Mirion-aire?
dj2.quest.db.46.desc=Craft a Mirion Ingot! You can either use Smeltery Alloying or use the Empowerer. The first option is easier for batch-crafting, the second is much easier for automation.
dj2.quest.db.47.title=GO-GO, TIER GO!
dj2.quest.db.47.desc=Transform a Demon Blood Shard into a Tier 5 Blood Orb.

dj2.quest.db.48.desc=Craft a full set of Terrasteel Armor! I always said the Green Power Ranger was the coolest anyway.%n%nAgain, no need to hurry with this one, but they do give some nice bonuses for Botania.
dj2.quest.db.49.title=Finally reaching the point I've been itching
dj2.quest.db.49.desc=Craft a Ring of Far Reach! This Ring lets you... well, you know what I'm gonna let you figure this one out.%n%nHint: Look at its name. (I mean c'mon it can't be more obvious than that!)
dj2.quest.db.50.title=YOU control the weather now!
dj2.quest.db.50.desc=Break a regular Environmental Accumulator and use materials obtained from this and the previous Chapter to upgrade it to a Sanguinary Environmental Accumulator!%n%nThis is a movable Environmental Accumulator which uses Blood to function. You'll need 8 Blood Tanks placed almost a knight step away, except instead of jumping 2-1 spaces, they're 3-1 spaces away.
dj2.quest.db.51.title=The Gatekeeper's Promise
dj2.quest.db.51.desc=Fly to the center of the world (x=0, z=0) in Omothol to find the Omothol Dungeon! If you're on a large Multiplayer server and your portal is very far away, feel free to use the Omothol Teleporter provided in the last quest!%n%nEnter the Dungeon. You'll find a room where you can perform Rituals if you wish. Once you're ready, go up to the second floor and find J'zahar, the Gatekeeper. Fight him!%n%nOnce he dies, he'll pull you in and EXPLODE! It probably goes without saying, but... STAY AWAY from the explosion! Then he'll drop the required item for this quest, the Essence of the Gatekeeper.
dj2.quest.db.52.title=Rocky Road Ahead
dj2.quest.db.52.desc=Runed Obsidian is the next tier of Standing Stone. Its main use, though, is in upgrading tools and equipment.

dj2.quest.db.54.title=Nom nom
dj2.quest.db.54.desc=If you're afraid of this Flower eating your arms off, then don't be - it specializes in eating Leaf Blocks only! Every 4 ticks (0.2 seconds) it searches an area of base size 17x17 centered around the Flower, and 16 blocks up for any Leaf Blocks. If it finds one, it'll gladly munch it up - generating 160 Mana per block. It's great if you have a lot of additional Saplings remaining from a Tree Farm!%n%nHowever be careful with this Flower. If it can't find any Leaf Blocks it'll go to sleep for 80 seconds! So you constantly want to feed it, otherwise it won't nearly be as efficient.%n%nIf you have a Mega Tree Farm going, you might be able to use multiple of these even!
dj2.quest.db.55.title=Alert: Gravity increasing
dj2.quest.db.55.desc=Upgrade your Sigil of Magnetism to the (much better) Ring of Magnetization. Place it in your Bauble slot. This Magnet is so powerful that items won't be able to escape your gravitational pull.%n%nIf however you'd like to disable the Magnet, you can place down a Solegnolia Flower. (Recommended near Mana Pools.)
dj2.quest.db.56.title=Fly like an angel!
dj2.quest.db.56.desc=Finally! Flight! But it doesn't come for free... you'll need to pay some Mana from a Mana Tablet in your inventory.

dj2.quest.db.58.title=Drill to the Drill
dj2.quest.db.58.desc=The Infinity Drill uses 10,000 RF or 3mb of Biofuel per block broken. At first, it can only mine a 1x1x1 area, but as the drill stores more and more power, it levels up and can mine increasingly large amounts of terrain. Shift+Right Click to cycle through the sizes.
dj2.quest.db.59.title=Dynamics have been Integrated
dj2.quest.db.59.desc=Craft a Menril Sapling and start duplicating it to get into Integrated Dynamics!%n%nThis mod isn't strictly required at this point, but it'll greatly help you with upcoming automation.%n%nMake sure to complete the tutorial in the rewarded Book, it'll help you a lot in understanding the mod.
dj2.quest.db.60.title=Chop Chop
dj2.quest.db.60.desc=Get more Menril! It's never enough!
dj2.quest.db.61.title=It varies
dj2.quest.db.61.desc=Craft a batch of Variable Cards! These hold information about the world and can be set in any Integrated Dynamics Reader or the Logic Programmer.%n%nWanna get rid of a Variable? You can convert it back into an empty Card in the Crafting Table.
dj2.quest.db.62.title=More Menril! MORE!
dj2.quest.db.62.desc=Craft a Squeezer and a Drying Basin! By setting them up side by side, you can place a Menril Log into the Squeezer, and jump on it a couple times to release its sweet nectar! The blue stuff - Menril Goo.
dj2.quest.db.63.title=Networking
dj2.quest.db.63.desc=Craft a bunch of Logic Cables! These are used to connect your entire Integrated Dynamics network from Readers, Writers, Display Panels to the Variable Store, Materializer, Delayer, or the Proxy.
dj2.quest.db.64.title=Okay this was fun for a while...
dj2.quest.db.64.desc=Wanna automate Menril production? These are the tools for you! A Mechanical Squeezer and a Mechanical Drying Basin.%nThese blocks have weird side restrictions, with both of them only allowing access to the item input slot from the Up, North, or West sides, and only allowing access to the item output slot from the Down, South, or East sides. Additionally, the Mechanical Squeezer allows access to the fluid input slot from all sides except Down, and only allows access to the fluid output output on the Down face.
dj2.quest.db.65.title=Cooler Dropper and Cooler Hopper
dj2.quest.db.65.desc=Craft an Item Interface! By placing this on a Chest, you can declare it as the inner storage for the network. Any item picked up by the network will be placed there, and any item required will be pulled from there.%n%nThen you can use the Dropper's and the Hopper's cooler brothers: the World Item Exporter and the World Item Importer.
dj2.quest.db.66.title=WiFi matter transmission
dj2.quest.db.66.desc=Craft a Wireless Terminal! While in range of your Wireless Access Point, you'll be able to wirelessly open your ME Network, and take out items you wish! You can also request autocrafting by middle clicking on an item.%n%nOh, you'd like a Wireless CRAFTING Terminal? Well, you'll have to wait... Some things don't come cheap.
dj2.quest.db.67.title=The world is my book!
dj2.quest.db.67.desc=Craft some Readers from Integrated Dynamics. These can obtain specific values from your world. These will be handy when automating max stat Astral Sorcery Crystals, since you can even read a block's NBT values!
dj2.quest.db.68.title=In need of more Variables?
dj2.quest.db.68.desc=If you don't want to read a Variable from the world, the Logic Programmer is the tool for you! It can create simple objects like booleans and integers, or more complicated ones like additions, subtractions, items dragged from JEI, and more!%n%nYou can also simply convert this into a portable version.
dj2.quest.db.69.title=Can't find my Variable!
dj2.quest.db.69.desc=The Network needs to see any Variable you referred to, and this is the place to store them. It's that simple!
dj2.quest.db.70.title=Really can't find my Variable!
dj2.quest.db.70.desc=if you want to convert a Variable into a Static, you can use a Materializer. Simply obtain a Variable Card from the world or from the Logic Programmer, place it inside with some fresh Variable Cards, and bam! Staticification!
dj2.quest.db.71.title=Jumping some hoops
dj2.quest.db.71.desc=Craft a Logic Director! This item simply acts as a crafting ingredient for "long-range" or "wireless" Integrated Dynamics items.
dj2.quest.db.72.title=Cooler Block Breaker and Cooler Block Placer
dj2.quest.db.72.desc=Same story as before, if you have an Item Interface somewhere on your Network, you can pick up and place blocks. This will be pretty handy for Livingrock automation, don't you think? (Although you can do that with Formation & Annihilation Planes as well.)
dj2.quest.db.73.title=Surround'er to the Matrix!
dj2.quest.db.73.desc=Craft some additional Pedestals to surround the Runix Matrix multiblock with! 8 is a good starting point, but you will need more eventually...
dj2.quest.db.74.title=Constructing the unconstructable
dj2.quest.db.74.desc=Craft a Runic Matrix and all required components listed in your Thaumonomicon! Set it up as it's shown there, then Right Click on the Runic Matrix block with some Salis Mundus.%n%nTo use it, place or pipe items onto the middle and outer Pedestals, have a sufficient amount of Essentia available in Jars nearby, and activate the ritual with your Caster's Gauntlet. Consider using Item Lasers from Actually Additions to add items to the Pedestals, they are very good at that!%n%nIt's crucial to have a symmetrical layout of Pedestals, Jars, and other blocks nearby, as that will boost the stability of the Infusion. If your Infusion Matrix is unstable, items could get knocked down during crafting, Pedestals could emit Flux, or worse: items could entirely get destroyed, and the infusion could fail.%n%nTo prevent this, besides having a symmetrical layout, you can place stabilizer items around, below and above the Altar in a symmetrical manner. These are:%n%n- Thaumcraft Candles,%n- Skulls, Heads,%n- Thaumcraft Stabilizers.%n%nBe aware that, unlike in 1.7.10, the more variety of items you have around your Altar, the better your stability will become. These could simply include different colored candles, but not different kinds of heads/skulls, still arranged in a symmetrical manner. E.g. if you have a Creeper Head 6 blocks away from your Runic Matrix in one direction, you should have a Creeper Head or any type of skull/head 6 blocks away in the other direction as well.%n%nStabilizers are your best option. They don't need to connect to the Altar in any way, they simply need to exist nearby. Although you have the option to connect them to all Pedestals with Redstone Inlay, which will prevent items getting knocked down or destroyed - although it won't prevent the Flux issues.%n%nLastly, it's important to mention that the range of which stabilizers are detected is a 17x17x11 cuboid centered around the central Pedestal.
dj2.quest.db.75.title=Removed
dj2.quest.db.75.desc=Craft the required components listed in the right and construct the Tender Ender Blender Machine Blueprint, and Right Click it to visualize the multiblock. Now, using the preview, assemble the multiblock! This machine can charge any Ender Utilities Ender Cores without the need to be in the End or risking blowing up an End Crystal. It simply requires power and nothing else!%n%nThe machine uses 3 Hatches: 1 Item Input, 1 Item Output and 1 Energy Input. You can decide where you'd like to place these. Any size of Item Input/Output Hatches will suffice, but you'll need to use at least a Reinforced Energy Input Hatch.%n%nThe central block is the Stabilized End Crystal (the preview doesn't always seem to show it correctly). The lower layer consists of 3 Hatches, Machine Controller, and 1 Casing in the center. 4 blocks of Fortified Glass go on above the Hatches and the Controller. Finally, another layer of 5 Casings is required to cap it off. The Blueprint also needs to be placed inside for the machine to function.
dj2.quest.db.76.title=It's mine now!
dj2.quest.db.76.desc=Craft a Warding Sigil! This ingredient is used in many of the Warded blocks that Thaumic Augmentation adds.
dj2.quest.db.77.title=I'm a real Thaumaturge now, mom!
dj2.quest.db.77.desc=This is how you do Infusion, right....? Riiiiiight...?!%n%nNo.%n%nThis just takes power. And some Pedestals with items on top.%n%nBut it's close! It'll prepare you for the reaaaal thing.
dj2.quest.db.78.title=Master of Vengeance - Enhanced!
dj2.quest.db.78.desc=Craft more Ender Ingots and Enhance them in your Crucible!
dj2.quest.db.79.title=Better than a Cauldron
dj2.quest.db.79.desc=Sprinkle some more Salis Mundus, this time on an EvilCraft Purifier to convert it into a Crucible!%n%nIf you've never played Thaumcraft before, it's best to set this up in a chunk where you don't have many important machines - so preferably slightly away from your base.%n%nTo use it, fill it up with Water (piping systems work), and light a fire below it (later you can use a piece of Nitor as well). Once it starts bubbling, throw in items to break them down into Essentia. Be wary though, Essentia slowly evaporates, creating bad magical energy in the chunk called "Flux". You want to avoid creating Flux as much as possible, so do your recipes quickly: Throw in exact (or almost exact) amounts to create sufficient Essentia, then throw in the catalyst - the upper item in JEI recipes.%n%nIf it doesn't work, check if you still have the correct amounts of Essentia using your Thaumometer or Goggles of Revealing. If not, throw in some additional ingredients.%n%nWarning: Do NOT accidentally Right Click an item onto the Crucible! This most often occurs with the Thaumometer. Don't try to scan the Cauldron while it's active! You can scan it in item form or a block form without Water inside.%n%nTo clean up the mess you've made, use Quartz Slivers! Throwing in one piece of them will suck up 2 units of Essentia and create a Vis Crystal. You should definitely make good use of this!%n%nYou can observe the Flux in a given chunk. If levels get higher than comfortable, simply move to a different chunk. Keep in mind, a small amount of Flux doesn't hurt, but if you accidentally throw in multiple stacks of an item and/or accidentally Shift+Right Click the Crucible to empty it, then you'll release all the Flux and you can say goodbye to the chunk you were doing your alchemy in - until a bit later on, when you obtain the tools to deal with Flux. Hopefully that chunk happens to NOT be in your base... Seriously, did you listen to me? I hope so...
dj2.quest.db.80.title=Don't flux it up!
dj2.quest.db.80.desc=Craft an Auxiliary Venting Port! By placing this next to the Essentia Smeltery, you can separate out some of the Flux as harmless steam, making it useful for automation - if you don't want to constantly pay attention to your Smelteries (which you don't). You might want to place multiple of them on the same Smeltery though.
dj2.quest.db.81.title=Finally! Crucible automation!
dj2.quest.db.81.desc=Craft some Alchemical Constructs! Although this quest only requires one, you'll definitely need more if you want to automate Crucible recipes. By placing 2 of these above a single Crucible, then Right Clicking the structure with a Salis Mundus, you'll transform it into a Thaumatorium! You can simply pump Essentia into the sides of this machine to automate any Crucible recipe.%n%nNote that each side only accepts 1 type of Essentia at once. Also if you put a Chest in front of the machine, the outputs will end up in there.
dj2.quest.db.82.title=Knowledge of the Lich
dj2.quest.db.82.desc=Defeat the Arch Lich in the final boss room and loot 4 Knowledges of the Sky!%n%n... May he rest in peace before reaching his goal.
dj2.quest.db.83.title=To the Sky! (-thern)
dj2.quest.db.83.desc=Craft a set of Apalachia Blocks to enter Skythern!
dj2.quest.db.84.title=Distributing Essentia has never been easier!
dj2.quest.db.84.desc=Craft an Auxiliary Slurry Pump! When placed next to an Essentia Smeltery, it acts as a new output, meaning that additional Arcane Alembics can be placed on top. Useful for additional speed and even less Essentia clog-up.
dj2.quest.db.85.title=Dust to Dust
dj2.quest.db.85.desc=Pulverize a Rainbow Tablet for Salis Mundus, then use the duplication recipe at least once to get 2 pieces of it!%n%nYou can automate the duplication recipe with a single RFTools Crafter. Setup 2 recipes for crafting Salis Mundus, one on Keep/Int, the other on Keep/ExtC. Fill the bottom two rows with the duplication ingredients, and leave 1 slot for Salis Mundus. Once all of these ingredients are in place, hit "R" to make the machine remember where the items should go. The slot with Salis Mundus will stay on 63 Salis Mundus at all times, and the rest will go in the output slot. Now you just need to pump in the ingredients and pump out the Salis Mundus (no need for a filter)!
dj2.quest.db.86.title=Buy 1 Get 1 50%% off!
dj2.quest.db.86.desc=Use your Awakened Cores to make an Awakened Dragon Token!
dj2.quest.db.87.title=Not a magician.. A scientist!
dj2.quest.db.87.desc=Right Click a Wood Table with your Scribing Tools to create a Research Table. Pick it up to complete this quest.%n%nThe Research Table will require Paper and non-empty Scribing Tools. To do research, simply click "Create Theory", and choose research options that pop up. Each time you click on an option, it uses up a piece of Paper and a bit of ink.%n%nFinishing the research will give you Research Points (or closer to a full point, if you don't get it to 100%%), which will be required to unlock further tasks in your Thaumonomicon.%n%nSometimes the research process will require additional items for a greater bonus. These items will be consumed! If you can't continue your theory because of this, simply click "Scrap Theory". This will let you create a completely new one, but won't give you your Paper, ink or additional items back that you used during the process.%n%nOnce you run out of lightbulbs up top, you can complete the Theory to gain the Research Points acquired during the process.%n%nYou might want to scan portions of the sky and phases of the Moon - they will sometimes be used during research.%n%nPlacing an Enchantment Table, Bookshelf, Arcane Workbench, Crucible, Focal Manipulator, or Brain in a Jar near the Research Table will let you "focus" on the given item at the beginning, granting you a much higher chance to learn about unique topics associated with these items.
dj2.quest.db.88.title=Inscribe, describe, but most importantly, SUBSCRIBE!

Okay, now back to crafting. Craft some Scribing Tools! Fill it up with ink by combining it with an Ink Sac in a Crafting Table to complete its research. If you ever run low on ink, you can fill it up again.
dj2.quest.db.89.title=Just a desk.
dj2.quest.db.89.desc=Craft a Thaumcraft Wood Table. It's easiest to find it in JEI by typing '@thaum table'.
dj2.quest.db.90.title=Rushing through the dimensions!
dj2.quest.db.90.desc=Craft a batch of Skythern Blocks to enter the final DivineRPG Twilight Dimension: Mortum.
dj2.quest.db.91.title=It's Essential to route it
dj2.quest.db.91.desc=Craft some Essentia Tubes! By connecting these to Arcane Alembics on top of an Essentia Smeltery on one side, and a Warded Jar on the other side, you can route your Essentia into said Jars.%n%nEvery single Pipe can only transmit 1 type of Essentia. Right Click on them with an Essentia Resonator to see the current type they're set to.%n%nThis whole setup is still mostly manual until you obtain the Filling Essentia Transmuters. Additional types of Pipes can help, but as of now, you'll still have to keep an eye on the setup while it's running. If you see any Pipes leaking purple stuff, slow down or stop the machine - you don't want Flux Rifts to spawn and tear your setup apart.
dj2.quest.db.92.title=Essentially... it's a Smeltery!
dj2.quest.db.92.desc=Craft an Essentia Smeltery! First set it up OUTSIDE of your base. By putting any material (that has Thaumcraft aspects shown) inside the machine, and Coal or Alumentum in the bottom slot, you can break down the material into its components.%n%nThese will first end up in the purple bar on the left, or travel into Arcane Alembics on top. Make sure not to completely fill the bar on the left, otherwise a large amount of Flux could escape and you'll be very sad if your machines get destroyed due to a Flux Rift.%n%nWARNING: Every time the machine produces an item, it ALWAYS has a chance to spill Flux into the Chunk it's located in. Once the Flux level reaches around 60-80, a Flux Rift could spawn.%n%nRight now you want to avoid this. There are three main ways of doing this:%n%n- Keep relocating the Essentia Smeltery. Only break it when the purple bar on the left is EMPTY, otherwise you'll release a lot of Flux, probably spawning a Flux Rift in the process.%n%n- Rush to complete this Chapter and the very beginning of Bewitchment (the next Chapter), to gain access to the Flux Condenser and the Flux Condenser Lattice. Using this machine you'll be able to slowly convert Flux in a Chunk into Vitium Essentia. If you feed your Essentia Smeltery slowly, you can completely get rid of Flux in a Chunk this way, and you won't have to worry about it. This might require multiple Flux Condensers for a single Smeltery though.%n%n- Make a glass roof at build height in that chunk and around it or in a dimension that has a bedrock roof and put your smelters there.%n%nTwo community assembled list of a group of preferred items to obtain Aspects, one intended for multiple essentia types per item and one intended for one essentia per item:%n%nFor the first one:%n%nPacked Ice - 15 §lGelum§r, 5 Ordo%nRotten Flesh - 5 §lHumanus§r, 5 §lVictus§r, 5 §lPerditio§r%nSkeleton Skull - 10 §lMortuus§r, 10 §lSpiritus§r, 10 §lExanimis§r%nEnder Arrow (Quark) - 11 §lMotus§r, 3 §lAversio§r, 7 §lAlienis§r%nAmber - 10 Vitreus, 10 §lVinculum§r%nOpal - 4 §lLuna§r, 4 Vitreus, 4 Praecantatio, 4 Desiderium%nGarnet - 4 §lStellae§r, 4 Vitreus, 4 §lPraemunio§r, 4 Desiderium%nScorned bricks - 10 §lDiabolus§r, 10 Praecantatio, 10 §lTenebrae§r, 10 §lIgnis§r%nDropper - 10 §lPermutatio§r, 26 Terra, 5 §lVacuos§r, 7 Potentia, 5 Machina%nCrafting Table - 12 §lInstrumentum§r, 20 §lFabrico§r, 12 Terra%nBook and Quill - 18 Herba, 3 Sensus, 11 §lAqua§r, 3 §lBestia§r, 3 §lVolatus§r, 3 §lCognitio§r, 10 §lAer§r%nPereskia - 5 Herba, 10 §lAuram§r, 2 Praecantatio, 2 Ordo%nEnergetic Alloy - 5 §lSol§r, 10 §lLux§r, 10 §lMetallum§r, 5 Sensus, 10 Potentia, 10 Desiderium%nNether Wart - 1 Herba, 2 §lVitium§r, 3 §lAlkimia§r%n%n(The §lbold§r aspects are unique to that item.)%n%nFor the second one:%n%nWool - Bestia(1)%nWool - Fabrico(1)%nNether Wart - Vitium(2)%nAconitum - Mortuus(1)%nAmber - Vinculum(1)%nLead - Ordo(1)%nEnder Pearl - Motus(1)%nClay - Aqua(1)%nCopper - Permutatio(1)%nOak Button - Machina%nEye of Ender - Praecantatio(1)%nIron Ingot - Metallum%nBlaze Powder - Alkimia(2)%nSkeleton Skull - Exanimis(2)%nWooden Shovel - Instrumentum%nBottle o Enchanting - Cognitio%nPumpkin - Herba%nDirt- Terra%nBone Block - Sensus%nBlaze Rod - Ignis(1)%nRedstone - Potentia%nTorches - Lux(1)%nFeather - Aer(1)%nFeather - Volatus(1)%nEnder Pearl - Alienis(1)%nBowl - Vacuos%nSilverwood Log - Auram(1)%nGarnet - Stellae(3)%nSnow - Gelum%nWooden Sword - Aversio%nInvar Boots - Praemunio%nGlass - Vitreus%nBlock of Gold - Desiderium(1)%nGold Ingot - Sol(2)%nHellebore Seeds - Diabolus(1)%nRotten Flesh- Humanus(2)%nOwl Wings - Luna(2)%nSand - Perditio(1)%nWheat - Victus(1)%nWormwood Seeds - Spiritus(1)%nDark Gem - Tenebrae(1)%n%n(Each item has a (number) which signifies how many aspects the item has that you do not want.)
dj2.quest.db.93.title=Matrix Algebra
dj2.quest.db.93.desc=Craft a batch of Matrix Multiplication Units! This item is only used for the Thaumcraft Runic Matrix and the Creative Thaumonomicon, so after exploring Skythern, you can build up to 8 of these multiblocks if necessary - since making more Runic Matrices definitely makes automation easier.%n%n%nInterestingly, there is some fine print on the Matrix Multiplication Unit and it says the following:%n%n"By subtracting a lambda variable from the main diagonal of a square matrix, and solving the equation of its determinant being equal to zero, you can find the eigenvalues of the given matrix. Each eigenvalue corresponds to an eigenvector, except if their algebraic multiplicity is greater than 1, in which case a whole eigensubspace. These can be calculated by substituting the obtained lambdas back into the matrix (before the determinant step), and finding the solution for the obtained low-rank linear system of equations. The solution of this will yield the eigensubspace. In the case of all eigensubspaces being one-dimensional (which statistically occurs with probability 1), we can order these eigenvectors into a square matrix as column vectors, denoted by C. And by forming the diagonal matrix of the corresponding eigenvectors, we obtain matrix U. Then surprisingly, the original matrix will be equal to the matrix product of C*U*C^(-1), called the eigendecomposition. This is useful for calculating a large power of the original matrix, since the k'th power of it will be equal to C*U^k*C^(-1), and calculating U^k is done by raising each term in the main diagonal to the k'th power. This can not only be used to estimate the value of matrix polynomials, but used to more easily find the limiting behavior of Markov-Chains, or find certain moments of a multivariate distribution more easily and make statistical predictions..."%n%nThe text continues, but the font size is getting smaller and smaller, and no more details can be made out clearly...
dj2.quest.db.94.title=The first step of becoming a Thaumaturge
dj2.quest.db.94.desc=Right Click on an Ender Crafter from Extended Crafting with a piece of Salis Mundus to obtain an Arcane Workbench.%n%nThis table requires additional resources for each craft: Up to 6 basic Vis Crystals in each corner and magical energy called "Vis" that's stored in each chunk. If you don't have enough Vis in your current Chunk to complete a given recipe, you might need to move to a different one.
dj2.quest.db.95.title=Zwhoosh to the wham!
dj2.quest.db.95.desc=Craft a Caster's Gauntlet! This handy tool allows you to cast Thaumcraft Spells as well as activate Infusion Rituals.
dj2.quest.db.96.title=Even Leatherererer
dj2.quest.db.96.desc=Craft some Magical Leather!%n%n%n%n%n%n%n...Tiered recipes, hurray!
dj2.quest.db.97.title=Gears, cogs, and MAGIC!
dj2.quest.db.97.desc=Craft a Simple Arcane Mechanism!%n%nIt's simple, it's arcane, and guess what, it's a mechanism. Yup.
dj2.quest.db.98.title=Brass yourself!
dj2.quest.db.98.desc=Craft some Alchemical Brass Ingots! This is the most important crafting ingredient in Thaumcraft, so make sure to semi-automate it for now, and fully automate it once you have access to Alchemical Constructs.
dj2.quest.db.99.title=Smellin' good!
dj2.quest.db.99.desc=Craft an Arcane Spa and some Purifying Bath Salts! Place the Salts inside and provide the Spa with Water. It will fill up a 5x5 area above it with Purifying Fluid that prevents any Warp effects for half an hour.%n%nAlso craft a Sanitizing Soap, which clears all Temporary Warp and has a chance of removing regular Warp on use.
dj2.quest.db.100.title=Add more Magic to it!
dj2.quest.db.100.desc=Craft a Complex Arcane Mechanism for more complex arcane devices that you would like to mechanize arcanely for the device to be mechanized in an even more arcane way than it was previously. Yup.
dj2.quest.db.101.title=It's makes you smarter! Or does it...?
dj2.quest.db.101.desc=Craft a Brain in a Jar! By placing this near your Research Table, you can select it and gain more Eldritch knowledge...%n%nBut be wary... It's forbidden knowledge... You might get some "unwanted" effects...
dj2.quest.db.102.title=I don't remember. But you do!
dj2.quest.db.102.desc=Craft a Mnemonic Matrix! By placing this on top of the Thaumatorium multiblock, it'll be able to remember up to 3 recipes. This is very useful for automation!
dj2.quest.db.103.title=An expensive one, to be sure...
dj2.quest.db.103.desc=Crystallize many of your Alchemical Brass Ingots into Crystallized Sodium Shards. Once you've collected enough, craft a single Sodium Ingot!%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%nYou'll need 41 Alchemical Brass Ingots. Good luck! You can also obtain this from Mortum dungeons very soon.
dj2.quest.db.104.title=Essentia?! Bwah, I don't need it!
dj2.quest.db.104.desc=Craft a Void Jar! Any Essentia that enters this Jar gets teleported into a different phase of reality! What, you thought it's just voided? Well, effectively yes, but Conservation of mass would say otherwise...
dj2.quest.db.105.title=warded.jar
dj2.quest.db.105.desc=Craft a couple Glass Phials and a Warded Jar! You'll need many of these, so definitely automate them. The Phials allow you to store 10 units of Essentia for easy transport, while the Jars each store 250 units.%n%nYou can break the Jars to pick them up, they won't lose any of their contents.
dj2.quest.db.106.title=Wouldn't be Thaumcraft without this
dj2.quest.db.106.desc=Upgrade an Alchemical Brass Ingot into a Thaumium Ingot! Now you're really diving deep into Thaumcraft...
dj2.quest.db.107.title=Discover and conquer
dj2.quest.db.107.desc=Craft a Thaumometer in your Arcane Workbench. You'll need to use one of each basic Vis Crystal. Then start scanning ALL the things!%n%nThis handy device lets you see the amount of Vis in a chunk, and lets you observe current Essentia amounts in a Crucible or during Infusion crafting.%n%nJust be wary NOT to use it on an active Crucible, because it'll eat it up.
dj2.quest.db.108.title=Just a cold stone desk.
dj2.quest.db.108.desc=Craft a Stone Table! This is simply a crafting ingredient.
dj2.quest.db.109.title=You're a real Tuber now!
dj2.quest.db.109.desc=The Essentia Buffer has 8 unique slots for Essentia built into a single Pipe - meaning it's usually capable of pulling Essentia even when normal Tubes wouldn't.
dj2.quest.db.110.title=Pipes? Check! Routing options? We still need more...
dj2.quest.db.110.desc=Craft all 4 types of Pipes listed here.%n%n- Essentia Valves can be turned on and off by hand or with a Redstone signal.%n- Restricted Tubes halve the suction passing through them.%n- Directional Tubes only accept suction from one side.%n- Filtered Tubes can be marked by Labels to filter for one type of Essentia.
dj2.quest.db.111.title=Thaumonomonomanomicon
dj2.quest.db.111.desc=Right Click on a Bookshelf with a piece of Salis Mundus to obtain your very own Thaumonomicon!%n%nYou'll need to discover every Thaumcraft recipe by following this book. Some tasks will require you to obtain or craft items, and some will consume them! Make sure to frequently check all the tabs on the left (and later right) to see if you have any research unlocked.%nBe aware that some quests in BQ will unlock before you have the research to complete them.%n%n§cMultiplayer information:§r This modpack has the mod Knowledge Sharer. This allows you to share research with your friends. To share research, both players must hold the Thaumonomicon in their hand, and the sending player must Shift+Right Click on the receiving player. %nNote that this will only share research, not other entries - meaning all players will have to scan entities like the Crimison Cult with their Thaumometer to progress. For this reason, each player must make their own Thaumonomicon.
dj2.quest.db.112.title=Resolve-nator
dj2.quest.db.112.desc=Craft an Essentia Resonator! This tool allows you to see where your Essentia is flowing to inside of your Thaumcraft pipe networks. Each pipe can only hold and create suction for one type of Essentia, so you might need to create a more complex network. The special types of Essentia Tubes will surely help you with that.
dj2.quest.db.113.title=Smeltery^2
dj2.quest.db.113.desc=Upgrade your Essentia Smeltery into the Thaumium variant! This machine has double the speed of the previous tier, and breaks up Essentia with a 90%% efficiency instead of 80%%.
dj2.quest.db.114.title=Essentia in, Essentia out
dj2.quest.db.114.desc=Craft an Essentia Centrifuge! This machine is capable of separating incoming Essentia into its primal elements - making it useful if you can create a more complex type of essentia more easily than a primal one. Though only one of the components will be returned for each input unit of Essentia.%n%nThe output can be pulled out from the top. It's best to use an Essentia Buffer here, as multiple types of Essentia could be output at the same time.
dj2.quest.db.115.title=SPELLS! MORE SPELLS!
dj2.quest.db.115.desc=Craft a Blank Advanced Focus! This will allow you to create more complex spells by granting you a higher amount of potential spell complexity.
dj2.quest.db.116.title=It's a Focus! ... But what does it do?
dj2.quest.db.116.desc=Craft a Blank Lesser Focus! You can use it to create Thaumcraft Foci with powerful effects in a Focal Manipulator. The GUI is very intuitive, you can just drag spell ingredients until your complexity maxes out. To cast the spells, use your Caster's Gauntlet.%n%nEach cast of a spell consumes a little bit of Vis in the chunk you're in, but don't worry, Vis does slowly regenerate over time.
dj2.quest.db.117.title=I made... Circles!
dj2.quest.db.117.desc=Craft all 2 pi radians of a Base Focal Sphere! This is the base crafting ingredient for all Foci!
dj2.quest.db.118.title=Pipes §r=§r Overrated
dj2.quest.db.118.desc=Finally! A Thaumaturge's dream comes true when they can create Essentia without any messy pipes or the worry of creating Flux...!%n%nSimply place a Filling Essentia Transfuser on the side of your Arcane Alembics, and they'll distribute the Essentia into nearby Jars without the need for any Pipes at all. Wonderful!
dj2.quest.db.119.title=Give me ALL the Vis!
dj2.quest.db.119.desc=Craft a Workbench Charger! To do so, find a Magical Forest biome, wear your full set of Thaumaturge Armor, and look for the perfect chunk that can barely craft this with the discount!%n%nOnce crafted, you can place it on top of an Arcane Workbench or a Focal Manipulator to be capable of draining Vis from the 8 surrounding chunks as well. This way you'll have access to recipes that have a way higher Vis cost.
dj2.quest.db.120.title=Like a button on your shirt
dj2.quest.db.120.desc=Craft a Vis Resonator! This is purely a crafting ingredient that you'll need a fair amount of.
dj2.quest.db.121.title=Spells are fun! So fun!
dj2.quest.db.121.desc=Craft a Focal Manipulator! Placing a Focus inside will let you create a variety of different Thaumcraft spells.%n%nTo start, place a Blank Lesser or Advanced focus in the bottom left slot. Then select a spell category on the left. Some categories (like Projectile) take a modifier (what type of projectile should it be?).%n%nYou can see the current complexity of your spell on the top right - this can't exceed the total capacity shown.%n%nOn the bottom right, you can choose to increase the effectiveness of certain attributes of your spell. This will make the spell stronger, but increase its complexity.%n%nOnce satisfied, the Focal Manipulator will ask for some items. These will be consumed! To finish, click the "Start Crafting" button on the top right. Wait a few seconds and your spell should be applied to your Focus and ready to use!%n%nTo apply the Focus to your Caster's Gauntlet, hold the Gauntlet and press 'C' by default.
dj2.quest.db.122.title=Academic? Try the Alembic!
dj2.quest.db.122.desc=Craft some Arcane Alembics and place them on top of your Essentia Smeltery! All the Essentia broken down from items will end up in these. Watch out though, if Essentia is visibly leaking, that'll create a lot of Flux in the Area, which is very dangerous! Always watch the purple meter inside the Essentia Smeltery, don't overflow it.%n%nYou can Right Click an Alembic with a Jar to get the Essentia stored inside or use piping to move it automatically to connected Jars. Watch out though, a single Pipe can only ever transmit 1 type of Essentia. If your input material contains a lot, you might not be able to route all of it. In that case, keep an eye on the system (an Essentia Resonator really helps), and break down the input in very small batches.
dj2.quest.db.123.title=What's this again? Potentia...? Vitreus?
dj2.quest.db.123.desc=Craft a Jar Label! Placing this on a Jar will not only let you organize them better, but use it as a filter - only Essentia of a given type will be capable of entering the Jar.%n%nAlso craft a Brass Lid Brace! When placed on a Jar, only Essentia Tubes will be able to access the Jar.
dj2.quest.db.124.title=Stunning Stones
dj2.quest.db.124.desc=Craft at least 1 Infusion Cost Stone and 1 Infusion Speed Stone. By placing them below the main legs of the Runic Matrix multiblock, you can either reduce the cost of the crafts or speed them up! Your choice... You can use at most 4 of these, obviously.
dj2.quest.db.125.title=You held it - now you'll wear it
dj2.quest.db.125.desc=Craft a pair of Goggles of Revealing! This is a very handy piece of equipment that goes into your helmet slot.%n%nIt lets you see the exact amounts of Essentia in your Crucible or Arcane Infusion crafts, and it's absolutely required, otherwise you can easily miss an obvious ingredient for a craft (especially for Crucible recipes, where Essentia just constantly evaporates).
dj2.quest.db.126.title=<3
dj2.quest.db.126.desc=Craft a Heart Amulet! This is an item equippable in one of your Bauble slots, and can hold up to 10 of each Heart Canister type.
dj2.quest.db.127.title=New outfit? Fancy!
dj2.quest.db.127.desc=Craft a set of Thaumaturge Armor! Using this you'll get a fair amount of Vis cost reduction on Arcane Workbench crafts.%n%nBy placing a set of Armor on a BiblioCraft Armor Stand with a Redstone Block below, you can easily swap between the set displayed and the set you're currently wearing. Handy!%n%n(To obtain Crystallized Alumina for Alumentum, combine Crystallized Aluminum and Oxygen Shards, and combine them into Crystallized Alumina.)
dj2.quest.db.128.title=Have you lost your mind (yet)?
dj2.quest.db.128.desc=Craft a Sanity Checker! By holding this item, a bar showing your current warp level will appear on the top left. Try to keep this... as low as possible. Especially the darkest purple bar on the bottom - that's Permanent Warp that cannot be gotten rid of.
dj2.quest.db.129.title=Loot!
dj2.quest.db.129.desc=Obtain the following loot by slaying certain mobs with your Athame:%n%n- Heart from Players, Villagers, Witches, Evokers, Illusioners, or Vindicators. (Witches are probably your best choice.)%n- Dimensional Sand from Endermen or Endermites.%n- Spectral Dust from any Undead mob like Skeletons or Zombies.%n%nHooves can be obtained from Pigs, Sheep, Cows, Horses, Zombie Pigman, Mooshrooms, Llamas, Donkeys, or Mules, even without using an Athame.
dj2.quest.db.130.title=Arthana 2.0
dj2.quest.db.130.desc=Craft an Athame! Killing various mobs with this might make them drop some special loot! (See: next quest.)
dj2.quest.db.131.title=Hot from inside out
dj2.quest.db.131.desc=Brew up some Fiery Unguent and automate it as best as you can!
dj2.quest.db.132.title=Hello, fellow Tallow!
dj2.quest.db.132.desc=Craft some Tallow!%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%nIt's Swellow's pre-evolution... or is it?
dj2.quest.db.133.title=It's like a sieve... but for liquids!
dj2.quest.db.133.desc=Make a Distillery! Make sure to place it near a Witches' Altar.%n%nTo automate this machine, you'll need to insert the ingredients from the top, Blaze Powder from the sides, and pull out the results from the bottom.%n%nHowever, you might come across some difficulties:%n%n- Items might end up in the wrong slots, for example 2 stacks of the same item get sent into the Distillery, instead of 2 stacks of unique ingredients.%n%n- Some recipes take fewer than 6 inputs, and the 6th slot also gets filled up - stopping the crafting process.%n%n- Some recipes take multiple stacks of the same item, and when they enter the machine, they don't spread out correctly.%n%nBut there is a fix for all of these!%n%nIntroducing (or more like revisiting a Chapter you've completed a long time ago): THE IMPULSE HOPPER! Simply set up a filter in the middle row, and the Impulse Hopper will only let a set of items through if all of the ones in the Filter have arrived.%n%nThis still poses an issue for crafts that take multiple of the same ingredients. The solution is rather simple though: Set the filters to be 64 of each item, and only let them through once multiple stacks have arrived. They are surely going to go in the correct spot!%n%nIf you're still having trouble because your input slots are filling up, use an Integrated Dynamics Block Reader on the Distillery or a buffer chest that checks if the target block is empty, and if so, emits a redstone signal to the Impulse Hopper (in Redstone Mode: Active with signal) which will let some items through.
dj2.quest.db.134.title=Oilin' up those Tiers and Tierin' up those Oils
dj2.quest.db.134.desc=Craft some Heaven Extract and Otherworldly Tears. One tastes like mashed potatoes except instead of potatoes it's more like clouds, and the other one tastes like scorched Ender Dragon wings. None of them are my favorite though.

dj2.quest.db.136.title=It never melts!
dj2.quest.db.136.desc=Throw some Splash Iceworld Potions on a field of Stone, Granite, or Diorite to convert it to Perpetual Ice! The Potion has a large spread range, it even goes underground a bit.
dj2.quest.db.137.title=Tough Purified Paste
dj2.quest.db.137.desc=It's time to perform your first Circle Rite.%n%nMake some Tough Purified Paste! You'll need to Right Click the ingredients on the Golden Rune in the center, then Right Click with an empty hand. If your Circle layout is correct and you have sufficient Altar Power, you'll be able to perform it.

dj2.quest.db.142.desc=Craft either a Silver, Iron, or Gold Candelabra! Placing this on top of your Altar will boost its Altar Power.
dj2.quest.db.143.title=Yet another Altar! Yay!
dj2.quest.db.143.desc=Craft any 6 pieces of Witches' Altars! Place them in a 2x3 formation and place any piece of Carpet on top to form the multiblock.%n%nThis structure provides power for all your Bewitchment machines to function. Witches' Cauldrons, Distilleries, Spinning Wheels, Braziers, and Circle Rites wouldn't function without sufficient Altar power in a 16 block radius. To run the Bewitchment cauldron and rituals, obtaining around one or two thousand Altar power would be a good idea as they require the most altar power out of all the Bewitchment machines.%n%nTo boost the power stored by your Altar, you need to spice up the immediate area with a bunch of wildlife! Trees, crops, growables, grass, flowers, fungi, anything you can think of. And variety helps! Two different types of crops will boost the power of your Altar more than two of the same type.%n%nTo boost the power further, you can also place any of the following items on the top 6 slots (in increasing order of effectiveness):%n%n- Cups: Flower Pot / Glass Bottle, Goblet, Flying Ointment, or Filled Goblet%n%n- Vanilla Swords or Athame (with the Diamond Sword and the Athame being the best).%n%n- Wands or lighting: Torch / Redstone Torch, Candles, Blaze Rod, Candelabra, End Rod, Leonard's Wand, Caduceus.%n%n- Pentacles: Head / Skeleton Skull, Redstone / Nether Quartz / Lapis Lazuli / Opal, Wither Skeleton Skull, Amethyst / Diamond / Emerald / Garnet / Prismarine Shard, Grimoire Magia, Idols, Pentacle, Demon Heart, any Statue, Dragon Head.%n%nMore information on the Bewitchment Wiki:%nhttps://bewitchment.fandom.com/wiki/Witches%%27_Altar/1.12

dj2.quest.db.154.desc=Distill some Demon Heart combined with some of your previous Oils, and add a pinch of Pride... for an interesting result.
dj2.quest.db.155.title=Slightly less Essential
dj2.quest.db.155.desc=Create the listed Essential Oils using your Witches' Oven! These ones aren't as frequently used as the ones in the "These are Essential!" quest, you only need to batch craft a few.
dj2.quest.db.156.title=Chock full of Chalk
dj2.quest.db.156.desc=Craft a piece of Ritual Chalk!%n%nYou can draw Bewitchment Circles with this tool. All Circles have to have a Golden Rune drawn in the center.%n%nThere are 3 layers of Circles you can draw:%n%n            ███████%n         █                 █%n      █      █████      █%n   █      █             █      █%n█      █      ███      █     ⠀█%n█   █      █        █      █   █%n█   █   █             █    █   █%n█   █   █      §6█⠀§r    █    █   █%n█   █   █             █    █   █%n█   █      █        █      █   █%n█      █      ███      █     ⠀█%n   █      █             █      █%n      █      █████      █%n         █                 █%n            ███████%n%nThe white squares represent White Chalk - but some Rites later will require Red or Purple Chalk to be used for one or more of the circles.%n%nYou can recolor your existing Circles with the Rite shown in your Book of Shadows / Rituals / Circle Drawing.

dj2.quest.db.159.title=Never gonna die anymore!
dj2.quest.db.159.desc=Craft a Death Protection Poppet. When bound to yourself with your own Taglock and held in your inventory or on a Poppet Shelf, it'll prevent a lethal blow by reincarnating you instantly using its own woven body.%n%nIf that's not witchy enough for you, then I don't know what is.%n%nYou will need to automate these using the second Poppet recipe... eventually.
dj2.quest.db.160.title=Itching for more Witching
dj2.quest.db.160.desc=Craft a Witches' Cauldron! Nyaaaahahahahahahahaaaaaa!%n%nThis machine functions very similarly to the Thaumcraft Crucible. You need to heat it up (a Magma Block, Fire, or Thaumcraft Nitor all work), fill it up with some Water, then throw in the required ingredients shown in JEI. However there are some key differences:%n%n- You need Altar power for each recipe. A Cauldron more than 16 blocks away from an Altar won't function.%n%n- You can't directly pipe Water into it. Instead, to automate it, you'll have to use a Mechanical User with a Water bucket inside. You can use an Eternal Water bucket or an Unending Bowl inside the Mechanical User to keep the Cauldron full without having to deal with refilling the bucket.%n%n- You can also brew Bewitchment Potions in the Witches' Cauldron. Simply start with a piece of Mandrake Root, add an additional ingredient (listed in JEI), and either Redstone or Glowstone, and optionally Gunpowder for the splash effect. Once done, Right Clicking with Empty Bottles will create the desired Potion.
dj2.quest.db.161.title=Magical Chalk!

dj2.quest.db.164.title=Ground Dragon
dj2.quest.db.164.desc=Perform one of the most difficult Cauldron recipes to create some Dragon Resin. Fortunately you'll only need to do this once.

dj2.quest.db.183.desc=Wanna be fancy and drink from a Goblet? Now is your chance! Not only will your wine taste better, but this will also give you an exquisite amount of Altar Power! Nice.
dj2.quest.db.184.title=Brrrrrrrrr... Icy!
dj2.quest.db.184.desc=Use your Witches' Cauldron to create an Iceworld II Splash Potion. You'll need to throw in the following ingredients in order:%n%n- Mandrake Root%n- Ice OR Snow block%n- Glowstone Dust%n- Gunpowder%n%nThen Right Click on the Cauldron three times with an Empty Bottle to get 3 of them!%n%n§6Only one task needs to be completed to allow people to complete the quest due to a bug.
dj2.quest.db.185.title=There is only one way out...
dj2.quest.db.185.desc=All this dark magic has messed with your brain... The only way out... The only way to end this... Is to go away with it... Go into the hellish Underworld by sacrificing yourself to a Curse... The Curse of Conflagration will be perfect...%n%nHow? Well, it's quite simple actually:%n%nFill a Taglock with your own juices by Shift+Right Clicking on a Bed you've slept in. (Don't try to think about it more than that.)%n%nHaving this, inflict yourself with the Curse of Conflagration using your Brazier. The ingredients can be found in your Codex Infernalis, under Curses / Conflagration.%n%nOnce under the Hell Fire status effect, use your Flame Devourer Pendant to obtain some Ignition!
dj2.quest.db.186.title=Curse them!
dj2.quest.db.186.desc=Craft a Brazier!%n%nTo use it, look up the Curses section in your Codex Infernalis. Place the input items on top, and light it with a Flint and Steel. The Curse will be cast on the player whose Taglock you've used.

dj2.quest.db.191.title=Wow, such Essentia Storage
dj2.quest.db.191.desc=Craft a 16k ME Essentia Storage Component.%n%nWhen upgraded to a Cell, it stores 128,000 units Essentia. Wow!%n%nHonestly that's more than you'll ever need, buuuuut, you can't stop before the finish line, can you?
dj2.quest.db.192.title=Storing your Essentia even more
dj2.quest.db.192.desc=Craft a 4k ME Essentia Storage Component! Just like regular Storage Components, when upgraded to a Storage Cell, these are capable of storing Essentia (instead of items).%n%nThis one stores 32,000 units of Essentia (8 times the size of the Cell).
dj2.quest.db.193.title=Conduct it all the way!
dj2.quest.db.193.desc=Use a FULLY CHARGED Impetus Conductor with an Impetus Crystal to craft Conducted Impetus. WARNING: Do NOT autocraft this. AE2 could eat up your inputs, if the given Impetus Conductor isn't fully charged*.%n%nTo charge your Impetus Conductor, insert it into your Void Recharge Pedestal. Make sure it has an incoming beam of Impetus.%n%n%n%n-------------------------------%n%n* This is because the charge value is (nontraditionally) stored in the Forge Cap NBT of the item, not the regular NBT.
dj2.quest.db.194.title=Using Impetus
dj2.quest.db.194.desc=Craft a Void Recharge Pedestal and connect a beam of Impetus to it. This machine charges any items that accept Impetus, such as an Impetus Conductor.
dj2.quest.db.195.title=Store your Essentia
dj2.quest.db.195.desc=Craft a 1k ME Essentia Storage Component. When upgraded to a Storage Cell, this is capable of storing 8000 units of Essentia. (8 times the size of the cell). That's 32 times the amount a single Jar can store, so these Components are VERY powerful.%n%nSimply place it in regular Drives, and use Essentia Import and Export Buses to distribute the Essentia between the outside world and your system. Just like you would with items!
dj2.quest.db.196.title=Homemade, Eldritch flavour
dj2.quest.db.196.desc=Upgrade a quarter stack of Void Stones to Eldritch Stones!
dj2.quest.db.197.title=Workbench Charger - for your Terminal
dj2.quest.db.197.desc=Craft an Arcane Charging Upgrade. Placing this in the slot on the right inside the Arcane Crafting Terminal's GUI or in the Arcane Assembler will act as a Workbench Charger - the Terminal or Assembler will be able to draw Vis from all 8 adjacent Chunks too!
dj2.quest.db.198.title=Digital Arcane Crafting
dj2.quest.db.198.desc=Craft an Arcane Crafting Terminal! Attaching this to your ME Network will let you pull items from your system for Arcane Crafts.%n%nUnfortunately we haven't been able to figure out a way to keep the 6 Vis Crystals refilled, so you'll still have to do that manually.

dj2.quest.db.199.title=Roar! More Core for sure!
dj2.quest.db.199.desc=Craft a Diffusion Core and a Coalescence Core to get into Thaumic Energistics!%n%nTo unlock the Thaumic Energistics tab in your Thaumonomicon, simply scan any Applied Energistics item or block.
dj2.quest.db.200.title=Void Rift? Pwah, it's mine!
dj2.quest.db.200.desc=Craft an Impetus Drainer! Placing this close to a Void Rift will start draining it. You can disable/enable this functionality with a Redstone signal.
dj2.quest.db.201.title=Break it apart!
dj2.quest.db.201.desc=Once you've defeated the Eldritch, break apart their tower, and loot the items listed on the right!
dj2.quest.db.202.title=The Core of Impetus
dj2.quest.db.202.desc=Craft an Impetus Jewel! This is the base crafting ingredient for all machines that interact with the energy gained from Void Rifts - also known as "Impetus".
dj2.quest.db.203.title=Defeating the Eldritch
dj2.quest.db.203.desc=Find an Eldritch Spire structure in the Emptiness and raid it!%n%nTo enter the Eldritch Spire, you need to use a Gauntlet to inject Impetus into the lock of the door, same way as entering the dimension.%n%nYou'll need to find 4 key pieces hidden throughout the dungeon and ascend the main tower to progress!%n%nDefeat the final boss and gain access to the Eldritch Revelation!
dj2.quest.db.204.title=The Ultimate Essentia Storage
dj2.quest.db.204.desc=Craft a 64k ME Essentia Storage Component!%n%nWhen upgraded to a Cell, it can store 512,000 units of Essentia. (That's 2048 times the amount a single Jar can store. Wow!)
dj2.quest.db.205.title=Preparing for Halloween?
dj2.quest.db.205.desc=Craft some SPOOOOKY Lanterns! You can also obtain these from the Emptiness dimension structures.
dj2.quest.db.206.title=Ritual of the Arcane
dj2.quest.db.206.desc=Craft 16 Arcanium Bases. You can only craft this while in the overworld and standing inside a concentric square of biomes of this shape (these are simply representing blocks, not chunks):%n%n%n§5███████%n█§c█████§5█%n█§c█§a███§c§█§c█§5█%n█§c█§a█§b█§a█§c█§5█%n█§c█§a███§c█§5█%n█§c█████§5█%n███████§r%n%nWith%n%n§5█§r §r=§r Mortum biome%n§c█§r §r=§r Hell (Nether) biome%n§a█§r §r=§r Magical Forest biome%n§b█§r §r=§r Ocean biome%n%n%nTo set this up, you need to use an Arcane Terraformer on top of where the Ocean biome is, with the following steps:%n%n1. Transform a Square area with Range §r=§r 4 into a Mortum biome.%n2. Transform a Square area with Range §r=§r 3 into a Hell biome.%n3. Transform a Square area with Range §r=§r 2 into a Magical Forest biome.%n4. Transform a Square area with Range §r=§r 1 into an Ocean biome.%n%nIf you're unsure if you've transformed the area correctly, you can craft a Ritualistic Biome Checker. by standing in the middle (right on top on the Arcane Terraformer) and Right Clicking the item, it'll tell you how many blocks you have correctly transformed into the required biome.%n%nYOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT THOUGH! There is some leeway. The recipe will still work if you only transformed:%n%n- 22 of the 24 Mortum biome blocks,%n- 15 of the 16 Hell biome blocks,%n- 7 of the 8 Magical Forest biome blocks.%n%nYou can only do this MANUALLY, and only your Player needs to stand in the central Ocean biome block, the Crafting Table can be further away (as long as you can still reach it).%n%nNote: There is sometimes a bug where the biome layout is entirely correct, and item can still be crafted, even though the crafting output is empty. Then you'll need to click the empty output slot to get the item. This is due to the recipe detecting Player location, not the Crafting Table's location.
dj2.quest.db.207.title=Shaping the world
dj2.quest.db.207.desc=Craft an Arcane Terraformer and 4 regular Biome Foci in an Arcane Workbench, then use each one in the 4 biomes listed to the right: Ocean, Magical Forest, Hell (Nether) & Mortum.%n%nWARNING: If you Shift+Right Click a Biome Focus, it will get cleared and turn it back into a regular version.%n%nThe Arcane Terraformer can take any of these Foci and turn a circular or square area around it into the wanted biome.%n%nFor this, it'll require 3 key ingredients:%n- Vis, drawn from the air.%n- Essentia, drawn from the 5 input hatches located on the sides and on the bottom. These are specifically for Terra, Aer, Ignis, Aqua, and Permutatio, with Permutatio being drawn from the bottom. The rest should be routed into their respective colored input plug using Essentia Tubes or ME Essentia Export Buses.%n- Impetus, drawn from an Impetus Relay, Impetus Matrix, or Impetus Drainer - routed by an Impetus Resonator.%n%nThese materials will only be used while the machine is active. To activate it, select the desired area in the GUI, then Right Click it with your Gauntlet.%n%n§6Note:§r Thaumic Augmentation (unconventionally) stores a lot of its NBT data in the Forge Cap NBT. Because of this, this quest has been changed to NBT-independent detection, which means that any Biome Focus is accepted. You'll still need the ones listed for the next quest, however.
dj2.quest.db.208.title=Don't (A)-Void these
dj2.quest.db.208.desc=Using your Void Seeds and materials from Bewitchment, craft some Cold Void Seeds, Cold Void Metal Ingots, and finally, Void Metal Ingots.%n%nWhat a process!
dj2.quest.db.209.title=If you haven't messed up yet, now is the time!
dj2.quest.db.209.desc=Pump a lot of Flux into a chunk! This can be best done by setting up a Crucible, filling it to the brim with items that have a high Essentia amount, then breaking or Shift+Right Clicking on the Cauldron.%n%nWARNING: Do NOT do this inside your base. Nearby is fine - although you'll need to keep an eye on the Void Rift spawned this way, not to cause Taint to spawn.%n%nUse a Causality Collapser on the Void Rift! This closes the Rift and drops a fair number of Void Seeds. You'll need a good amount of them, so repeat this process a couple of times.
dj2.quest.db.210.title=Causing Collapses
dj2.quest.db.210.desc=Craft a couple Causality Collapsers! Depending on your luck, you may need more than the 5 needed to complete the quest.%n%nThe chance that a Rift drops a Primordial Pearl is based on its size, capping at 10%%.
dj2.quest.db.211.title=November 27, 1784: Proposed. Today: Developed.
dj2.quest.db.211.desc=Craft a Chaotic Energy Core!
dj2.quest.db.212.title=It isn't so Empty after all...
dj2.quest.db.212.desc=Mine up a stack of the base Stone of the Emptiness: Void Stones!
dj2.quest.db.213.title=Enter the Emptiness
dj2.quest.db.213.desc=Discover a tear in the fabric of spacetime, and activate it with your newly acquired Gauntlet that has an Impetus Conductor attached!%n%nThen enter the Emptiness...
dj2.quest.db.214.title=Outer Essentia Storage
dj2.quest.db.214.desc=Sometimes you want to store the Essentia outside of your Storage Cells (for a subnet, for a simple setup that doesn't need as much Essentia, etc.), and these components can come useful.
dj2.quest.db.215.title=Getting the Essentia in & out
dj2.quest.db.215.desc=Craft an ME Essentia Import Bus & Export Bus.%n%nThey can import / export Essentia from Jars into your Essentia storage system. They can also accept all types of Cards that regular Import and Export Buses can.%n%nTo filter them, use Phials of Essentia.
dj2.quest.db.216.title=A Stepping Stone
dj2.quest.db.216.desc=Loot or craft some Ancient Pedestals! Using Ancient Stones instead of Arcane Stones, and Ancient Pedestals instead of Arcane Pedestals, you can upgrade your Infusion Altar.%n%nThis new Infusion Altar comes with decreased Essentia costs and increased stability.%n%nOnce it's formed, the center pedestal does not need to remain an Ancient Pedestal.%n%nYou can also place down Ancient Pedestals instead of Arcane Pedestals around the Infusion Altar, reducing Essentia Costs and increasing speed slightly at the cost of increased Instability. You do not need Ancient Pedestals for an Ancient Infusion Altar to function, any Pedestal will work.
dj2.quest.db.217.title=Auto Infusion Matrix
dj2.quest.db.217.desc=Craft all the required items on the right for an Auto Infusion Matrix multiblock!%n%nCheck the figure in JEI and set up the machine. Make sure to place the Blueprint inside the Machine Controller.%n%nWATCH OUT: You should set it up in a single chunk, and make sure it's more than 16 blocks away from any Thaumcraft Filling Essentia Transfusers you're not planning to use for this machine!%n%nTHE SETUP: There are 41 individual Essentia Input Hatches on the machine, since there are 41 types of Essentia. Each one should be whitelisted to only accept 1 unique type of Essentia. To do this, place a total of 41 Essentia Export Buses (or Storage Buses with a higher priority than your Drives) on each individual Essentia Input Hatch.%n%nEssentia Input Hatchs basically act like Jars, having a max capacity of 250 units of Essentia, but unlike Jars, do not store their contents when broken, instead voiding it - this will NOT create any Flux, so feel free to do so.%n%nFIRSTLY: Of course, you'll need a sufficient supply of ALL 41 types of Essentia before you can use this machine effectively. Setup a large automation facility to convert basic materials into Essentia (like Stone into Terra, Redstone into Potentia, etc.).%n%nBUT WHAT ABOUT THE FLUX? Spread out your facility over multiple chunks and use many Flux Condensers to get rid of the Flux. More optimally, let a Flux Rift build, and stabilize it using Stability Field Generators. These are rewarded, although you may need to craft more. Once the Rift is stabilized, you can generate as much Flux in the Chunk as you want, about 32,000 is the limit. Have at it! %n%nBE AWARE that if the Thaumonomicon requires you to craft something in the Infusion Altar, using this machine WON'T COUNT. So do all your crafts in the regular Infusion Altar first.%n%nNote: This whole automation setup will take a while, so don't be discouraged by getting stuck on this quest for a couple days even.%n%nAlso Note: The Essentia Import Hatches don't get colored due to a bug with Modular Magic.

dj2.quest.db.218.desc=Craft an Essentia Infusion Provider!%n%nUsing your Thaumic Energistics system, you can provide Essentia for regular Infusions with this. No need for Jars anymore!%n%nHowever, since "vanilla" Infusion itself cannot be fully automated, I recommend using this in the Auto Infusion Matrix, a custom Modular Machinery Multiblock.
dj2.quest.db.219.title=Smelting^3
dj2.quest.db.219.desc=Craft the most efficient Essentia Smeltery, the Void Metal Essentia Smeltery. This machine has a much lower chance of producing Flux than the previous variants but is slower than the Thaumium Essentia smeltery. Though you'll still need to use Flux Condensers if you fully want to get rid of flux.
dj2.quest.db.220.title=The Peak of Alchemy
dj2.quest.db.220.desc=Craft an Advanced Alchemical Construct! This is purely a crafting ingredient for (you guessed it) advanced alchemy.
dj2.quest.db.221.title=Power of the Void - Stuck together
dj2.quest.db.221.desc=It's vibrating... what is it up to?
dj2.quest.db.222.title=Power of the Void
dj2.quest.db.222.desc=Using your Primordial Pearl and Void Metal craft some Impetus Crystals!%n%nWARNING: Do NOT break the Primordial Pearl. Keep repairing it instead. If you accidentally do, you'll have to obtain another one, which could be quite painful.
dj2.quest.db.223.title=Molding the Void
dj2.quest.db.223.desc=Craft a Thaumium Caster's Gauntlet, and apply an Impetus Conductor to it by crafting. Now, charge the Impetus Cell by right clicking on a rift - its power will be drawn into the glove!%nIf you need to remove the Impetus Conductor from the gauntlet, simply place the gauntlet in the crafting grid.%n%nWARNING: If you had previous Foci attached, remove them before crafting!
dj2.quest.db.224.title=A tear in spacetime
dj2.quest.db.224.desc=Craft a Fracture Locator!%n%nBefore you do the following, make sure you have a Gauntlet with an Impetus Conductor attached (the quest below this).%n%nOh you do? Well then, let me explain.%n%nThere are tears in spacetime that are pretty difficult to notice without an external tool... And they seem to be more common in the Nether than any other place.%n%nBut this invention will let you locate them! It'll brighten up if you get close to and you FACE TOWARD a tear.%n%nTime to spin around in the Nether like it's breakdance!
dj2.quest.db.225.title=A rare drop
dj2.quest.db.225.desc=While destroying Flux Rifts with your Causality Collapsers, you might come across a very rare item - the Primordial Pearl. It'll most likely be damaged the first time you obtain it, so it'll have a different name, likely "Primordial Mote" or "Primordial Nodule".%n%nThis item is used in a multitude of crafts, always only using 1 durability per craft.%n%nIn this pack however, you can also repair the Primordial Pearl with a Tool Poppet! Each Poppet will add back 1 durability point. This can ONLY be done manually, however, the Primordial Pearl isn't used in a lot of crafts.
dj2.quest.db.226.title=The final Stepping Stone
dj2.quest.db.226.desc=Craft 8 Eldritch Pedestals! These are used for the Impetus Matrix multiblock, and they also give an even more increased Essentia cost reduction, and an even more increased stability when used for the regular Infusion Matrix multiblock.%n%nYou can also place down Eldritch Pedestals instead of Arcane Pedestals around the Infusion Altar, reducing Instability and increasing the speed, but slightly increasing Essentia costs. You do not need Eldritch Pedestals for an Eldritch Infusion Altar to function, any Pedestal will work. Take care not to leave an Eldritch Pedestal unbalanced, as it will massively increase Instability.
dj2.quest.db.227.title=Routing Impetus
dj2.quest.db.227.desc=Craft an Impetus Resonator and a couple Impetus Relays!%n%nThe Resonator is capable of routing the Impetus you collect. Set the input by Shift+Right Clicking on a machine or node, and set the output by Right Clicking on another one.%n%nRelays are 1-input 1-output connectors to transfer Impetus with.
dj2.quest.db.228.title=In its full glory
dj2.quest.db.228.desc=Fully repair the Primordial Pearl with multiple Tool Poppets!
dj2.quest.db.229.title=777 53V3N 777
dj2.quest.db.229.desc=Craft an Elite Crafting Table (7x7)!
dj2.quest.db.230.title=Portal to Arcana
dj2.quest.db.230.desc=Craft 12 Arcana Portal Frames!%n%nTo set them up, stand in the middle of where the Portal will go, and rotate around, placing the Portal Frame blocks without moving. The shape is exactly the same as an End Portal, 5x5 without corners.%n%nYou'll know if you set it up the right way if the little circles on the side of each Portal Frame block point inside - or, if the portal activates and you end up in the Dungeon of Arcana. That's also a good indication.
dj2.quest.db.231.title=Dealing with Flux
dj2.quest.db.231.desc=Alright, enough with the Flux!%n%nThis is an automatable way of getting rid of the Flux you've accumulated in a Chunk. Craft the items shown on the right, and place the Flux Condenser Lattice on top of the Flux Condenser, feed it any kind of Essentia from the 4 sides, and pump out Vitium Essentia on the bottom.%n%nIf you can reliably store the output Vitium Essentia, then do so - otherwise pump it into a Void Jar. If the output Jar fills up, it'll STOP the Flux Condenser, and you'll be sad to see your machines destroyed by a Flux Rift in the same Chunk.%n%nThe Flux Condenser Lattice might periodically clog up, but you can Right Click on it with an Essentia Filter to unclog it. This uses up the Essentia Filter (but only if the Lattice is clogged). Once you have enough materials, automate Essentia Filters in regular crafting.
dj2.quest.db.232.title=Storing Impetus
dj2.quest.db.232.desc=Set up the Impetus Matrix multiblock, requiring a Runic Matrix block and 2 Eldritch Pedestals placed on the top and the bottom; sprinkled with some Salis Mundus.%n%nThis multiblock structure is capable of storing Impetus. However, to use it, you'll also need to insert at least 1 (but up to 8) Impetus Cells in the side of the bottom and top Eldritch Pedestals.%n%nSimilarly to the Infusion Matrix multiblock, this one also requires stabilization. The more Impetus stored inside, the less stable it will become - knocking down Impetus Cells and losing stored Impetus. However the range at which it detects stabilizer items is only 5 blocks (counted from the bottom Pedestal).%n%nThe methods are the same though - a variety of Candles, Skulls, or even better, a symmetrical layout of Stabilizers will do.%n%nIt takes a little while for the multiblock to detect the Stabilizers, but around 8 will likely be more than enough (of course, laid out in a symmetrical manner).
dj2.quest.db.233.title=View your Essentia
dj2.quest.db.233.desc=Craft an ME Essentia Terminal. Attaching this to your ME Network will let you see the amount of Essentia stored on it.%n%nYou can also use Phials to quickly fill or empty some Essentia directly through the Terminal.
dj2.quest.db.234.title=The final missing resource...
dj2.quest.db.234.desc=You've been able to automate almost everything in Thaumcraft... but there is one more missing piece.%n%nVis!%n%nWith this block however, you can slowly regenerate Vis in a Chunk. And they stack! In the lategame, you can place down hundreds of these in the chunk(s) you're doing Thaumcraft in to regenerate all the Vis very quickly!
dj2.quest.db.235.title=Fifth time. Final time.
dj2.quest.db.235.desc=Craft some Mortum Blocks!%n%nBut hold on... the recipe only gives 3 now... What will THIS be useful for?
dj2.quest.db.236.title=Even more charge
dj2.quest.db.236.desc=Upgrade your current Lightning Cell to the Advanced version, capable of storing a lot more LE!
dj2.quest.db.237.title=So this is what I needed Demon Hearts for...!
dj2.quest.db.237.desc=Defeat or Powered Spawn some Demon Soldiers, found naturally spawning in the Nether.%n%nAnd now that you have a sufficient source of Demon Hearts, infuse some Demonstones as well! Note that once you go to the Underworld you can find Demonstones in structures, very handy.
dj2.quest.db.238.title=Scary Monsters and Nice Dragons
dj2.quest.db.238.desc=You're stronger now.%n%nMuch stronger.%n%nIt's time.%n%nTravel to 2 coordinates to the end that are both a multiple of 10,000 to find the island of the Chaos Guardian.%n%nMake sure to bring additional charge for your armor.%n%nDefeat the Dragon.%n%nDig down in the center and collect its Chaos Shards.%n%nQuickly fly away, before the island goes boom. (The explosion even kills in Creative mode.)%n%nGood luck!%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%nHooooo jyaaah...!! Sunshu-- uh, o ah yaa-aah!%nEh-eh oh eh o e AH! Eh-eh ooooo-ooooj!%nHooooo jyaaah...!! Sunshu-- uh, o ah yaa-aah!%nEh-eh oh eh o e AH! YEWS! OH MY GOD!
dj2.quest.db.239.title=§5Requires the Induction Smelter§r
dj2.quest.db.239.desc=
dj2.quest.db.240.title=From the skies it strikes
dj2.quest.db.240.desc=Craft a Skyfather Ingot in your Lightning Infusion Table!
dj2.quest.db.241.title=Storing the power of Lightning
dj2.quest.db.241.desc=Craft a Lightning Energy Cell! This device is capable of storing LE (Lightning Energy), and automatically powering any LE consuming machine placed next to it.%n%nTo charge it with LE, place some kind of a Terminal on top, and swing your Golden Club to summon Lightning! Later you'll be able to automatically gain Lightning Energy too, but for now, this is the only method.
dj2.quest.db.242.title=Air Terminal Ranking
dj2.quest.db.242.desc=Craft up tiers of Air Terminals until you reach the Copper Air Terminal!%n%nPlacing any of these on top of a Lightning Energy Cell and then summoning Lightning on top will fill the Cell with a bit of LE (Lightning Energy). The amount of LE per Lightning is determined by the type of the Air Terminal.
dj2.quest.db.243.title=Infusing with Lightning
dj2.quest.db.243.desc=Craft a Lightning Infusion Table!%n%nThis machine requires LE (Lightning Energy) to function. See the nearby quests on how to generate LE.%n%nYou will no longer need to create Electricium in-world, you can use this machine from now on.%n%nEach recipe in the Lightning Infusion Table takes exactly 30 seconds to craft. Later you can upgrade the machine so each recipe will take exactly 15 seconds.%n%nYou will soon unlock an upgradable multiblock that will process all recipes inside the table much quicker, and with less lag.
dj2.quest.db.244.title=Vanilla start with extra Nightmares
dj2.quest.db.244.desc=Make a Crafting Table and use it to create a Moonlight Furnace. It works functionally the same as a regular Furnace. Use it to smelt your Ores you create with Dream Stone and Dream Dirt!
dj2.quest.db.245.title=I remember doing this...!
dj2.quest.db.245.desc=Craft a Wooden Pickaxe and collect some Dream Stones! These work exactly like Cobblestone, with the exception of being able to use it and Dream Dirt to magically conjure up some Ores...!
dj2.quest.db.246.title=Alloying again...
dj2.quest.db.246.desc=Alloy up some Invar in your Smeltery!
dj2.quest.db.247.title=Becoming stronger with Tinkers'
dj2.quest.db.247.desc=Make some Seared Bricks and set up a basic Smeltery! You can obtain Lava from Fire Crystals, and you can create some useful alloys to make powerful tools and weapons!%n%nMake sure to create a powerful Cleaver or Longsword and some kind of ranged weapon!
dj2.quest.db.248.title=Rainbow mode: ACTIVATED
dj2.quest.db.248.desc=Craft a Painting Machine. This will let you disguise facades as other blocks, along with other painting shenanigans, like appearing to be in GalactiCraft by painting your EnderIO Helmet as a glass block.
dj2.quest.db.249.title=Becoming strong with Tinkers'
dj2.quest.db.249.desc=Setup a small base (I recommend simply digging into a wall), and craft all Tinkers' Tables listed to the right. Create some Tools that are better than the Vanilla ones!
dj2.quest.db.250.title=Softening Dream Dirt
dj2.quest.db.250.desc=Use Dream Dirt, Dream Stone, and Water to obtain Sand, Gravel, and Clay!
dj2.quest.db.251.title=Water §r=§r Life
dj2.quest.db.251.desc=Once you've collected 8 pieces of Firelights, you can obtain 2 Water Buckets to make an infinite Water source.%n%nUsing this, make Mushrooms and Mushroom Stew for food!
dj2.quest.db.252.title=Light the Fire, spill the Water!
dj2.quest.db.252.desc=Find some Firelights randomly scattered across Vethea! It's most common on the top layer, but before having access to good equipment, stay on the bottom layer and look for brown structures that may include this block!
dj2.quest.db.253.title=Conjuring Ores
dj2.quest.db.253.desc=Use Dream Stone and Dream Dirt in the Crafting Table to obtain all of the Ores listed to the right.%n%nSome additional ones are also available if you want to make tools, weapons, or anything else out of them. Look up the usage of Dream Dirt or Dream Stone, and scroll to the end to see their recipes!%n%nThese are: Lapis, Realmite, Arlemite, Rupee, Quartz, and Salt Ores.
dj2.quest.db.254.title=Get that power out!
dj2.quest.db.254.desc=Craft a Redstone Flux Power Tap. You need that sweet-sweet power, man!
dj2.quest.db.255.title=Max Power
dj2.quest.db.255.desc=Craft some Reactor Casings to get into Extreme Reactors! This mod works exactly like the 1.7.10 Big Reactors mod. However since it's only available so late into the game, Reactors generate WAY more power this time!%n%nHow much power? 500 times the default.%n%n%nYeah.%n%nBy the way, if you're new to Extreme Reactors (or Big Reactors), make sure to read the guide book rewarded for this quest! It contains information on how to construct, activate, and use these reactors.%n%nOh, and by the way, they can't blow up. It's not a possibility that's coded in. Hurray!%n%nIf you want to test out your reactor output, you can go to §6br.sidoh.org§r - it was made for Big Reactors, but Extreme Reactors follows the same math. Keep in mind that power output will be 500 times what is listed!
dj2.quest.db.256.title=Into Immersive: Again!
dj2.quest.db.256.desc=Craft 27 Coke Bricks and Blast Bricks! Also craft an Engineer's Hammer and use it to form the multiblocks!%n%nSimilarly to how you did it before, create Coal Coke and create Steel!
dj2.quest.db.257.title=Get to the top(-per)!
dj2.quest.db.257.desc=Advance to the topmost layer of Vethea and find a rare structure: an Arena made of Luna Bricks. Collect a couple of the Bricks and head out!%n%n%n%n%n%nBy the way, this Arena would host the final boss of Vethea, but it's so ridiculously overtuned, that I can't wholeheartedly require you to fight it... It's Lady Luna and she has 4000 hearts of health and can two-shot you with acid on the ground, not to mention you can only damage her with either melee, ranged, or arcanic weapons, depending on her current form which she changes about every 10-15 seconds.%n%nI DO NOT recommend summoning her, but if you're up for a challenge (and I mean REALLY up for one), then use a Moon Clock at the Lunic Altar to summon her... But don't tell me that I didn't warn you.
dj2.quest.db.258.title=Harder, better, faster, stronger
dj2.quest.db.258.desc=Upgrade your LE Transmitters and Receivers to Tier 2 for more efficient wireless transmission!%n%n§6You only need to do one task.
dj2.quest.db.259.title=Wireless LE
dj2.quest.db.259.desc=Craft a Tier 1 LE Transmitter or a Tier 1 LE Receiver! Place the Transmitter next to the Lightning Energy Cell where you're generating LE, and place the Receiver next to a Lightning Infusion Table to provide it with LE!%n%nTo connect them up, craft a Tx/Rx tag, Shift+Right Click the Transmitter and Right Click the Receiver. To use the Tx/Rx tag again, simply craft it into a fresh one in the Crafting Table.%n%nUnfortunately due to the nature of Lightning Energy, it cannot be transmitted through mundane cables, so the only option is to send it wirelessly!%n%n§l§6You only need to do one task.
dj2.quest.db.260.title=Special Room: Restroom
dj2.quest.db.260.desc=Find a Restroom where Datticon might hide! Collect some of the Furnaces inside. These will be used later on...%n%nIf you met Datticon, remember where this room is, you'll need to trade with her soon.
dj2.quest.db.261.title=Raid: Arcane Legends
dj2.quest.db.261.desc=This modpack's been sponsored by Raid: Arcane Legends! Simply load into the Dungeon of Arcana using the link in the description, defeat mobs, trade with NPCs and collect various powerful materials! You can choose to be a melee fighter or a ranged archer! No microtransactions*%n%nThe rewarded Levers are used to open doors with incredible loot behind!! (Or, just Raw Arcanium...)%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n* I swear**%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n** Okay, fine, there are microtransactions, you got me...
dj2.quest.db.262.title=Cell Types and Maximizing Storage
dj2.quest.db.262.desc=Craft the Cell Workbench, a block used to filter AE2 Storage Cells and View Cells.%n%nView Cells are items that go in the top right slots of any terminal, and display only specific items. This can be quite useful in certain situations, as having exclusively the relevant items for a task can allow for easier monitoring. As an example, a View Cell that filters to only show the specific items you have passived, to tell what is struggling to fill up its buffers at a glance, can be very useful for debugging issues and ensuring you don't forget to install necessary upgrade/downgrade.%nAlternatively, they can be inverted with the Inverter Card, allowing you to hide undesired items - such as those nuggets taking up the top rows in lategame.%n%nStorage Cells being filtered restricts what items can be placed inside. Doing this can allow significantly increases storage of specific items.%nThis is because AE2 Storage Cells have a specific number of bytes for storage. Each item is a single bit, allowing for a storage of 8 times as many bytes, and each different type of items requires some bytes being allocated.%nAs an example, for each additional type in a 1k Storage Cell, you can store 128 less items. This is due to each unique type requiring 8 bytes. If only a single item is inside, it can store 8,128 items - 127 stacks. But if all 63 types are used, it can only store 4,160 items - 65 stacks.%nIn larger Storage Cells, the amount of bytes required for a new type of item increases.%n%nThis same effect happens to any type of Storage Cell, although with a varying number of maximum types - Fluid Storage Cells and Gas Storage Cells only have a maximum of 5, and Essentia Storage Cells have 12.
dj2.quest.db.263.title=Undergoing some travels
dj2.quest.db.263.desc=Craft an Underworld Charge to charge up the Underworld with...
dj2.quest.db.264.title=Heliosis' Dream
dj2.quest.db.264.desc=Find a large brown structure on the top layer of Vethea. Get through a small parkour puzzle and loot some Heliosis Lumps from Chests at the end! Use them to craft an Ender Chest!%n%nYou can also create dyes to color your Ender Chest. Lookup the usage of DivineRPG Acid to see how they're made. Of course, Lapis is also available. To secure the Ender Chest, use a piece of Diamond on its handle. Of course, this means you also need an Ender Chest with a piece of Diamond attached on the other side.%n%nSend back 4 Souls Vials to the Overworld that contain different types of mobs from each layer so you can Powered Spawn them for their Pearls.%n%n%n%nWARNING: Do NOT attempt to spawn Raglok. It will crash your game (or server) and corrupt the world. Yikes! You do NOT need any loot from it.
dj2.quest.db.265.title=Endering the final stage!
dj2.quest.db.265.desc=Combine Dirty Pearls, Acid, and Emerald to conjure an Ender Pearl.%n%nThen upgrade it into an Eye of the Nightmare using some Blaze Powder, a slice of Glistering Melon and some Shiny Pearls!
dj2.quest.db.266.title=A machine casing... again.
dj2.quest.db.266.desc=Energize some Osmium and craft a Mekanism Steel Casing!
dj2.quest.db.267.title=Walls + Pearls + Water §r=§r ??
dj2.quest.db.267.desc=Biodiesel!%n%nThat's what they make.%n%nFor some reason...
dj2.quest.db.268.title=Awaken the Dungeon's Fiends
dj2.quest.db.268.desc=Find a room with some Parasecta or Dramix Altars inside the Dungeon of Arcana! Place your Wizards Book on one of them to spawn Parasecta / Dramix!%n%nDefeat it and collect your loot, the Dungeon Tokens!
dj2.quest.db.269.title=You're not a Wizard, Steve!
dj2.quest.db.269.desc=Find Lord Vatticus inside his special room (the small Library) in the Dungeon of Arcana. Exchange some Arcanium with him for a Wizards Book!
dj2.quest.db.270.title=Getting your hands dirty
dj2.quest.db.270.desc=Locate a tree of some Logs nearby and dig a tunnel towards it, collecting some Dream Dirt in the meantime.%n%nBut WATCH OUT: there is NO BEDROCK LAYER at Y=0, so always watch your height level when mining below ground! Don't fall out of the world!
dj2.quest.db.271.title=Club-achu! Evolve!
dj2.quest.db.271.desc=Craft some Thunderstones!%n%n(You can get Scorned Bricks from Compressed Netherrack and Compressed Obsidian.)
dj2.quest.db.272.title=It's farther down than the Nether
dj2.quest.db.272.desc=Build up a vertical Portal of a 2x2 inside (or 4x4 outside) shape out of Demonstone and light it with your Underworld Charge. (You do not need to have corner blocks.)%n%nThen enter the Underworld!
dj2.quest.db.273.title=Automating Demon Hearts
dj2.quest.db.273.desc=If you haven't done so yet, automate Demon Hearts by using the duplication recipe in the alloy smelter.
dj2.quest.db.274.title=Even better Air Terminal
dj2.quest.db.274.desc=Upgrade your Electricium Air Terminal into a Skyfather variant!
dj2.quest.db.275.title=Better Air Terminal
dj2.quest.db.275.desc=Craft an Electricium Air Terminal for even more efficiency!
dj2.quest.db.276.title=Lightning fast
dj2.quest.db.276.desc=Craft a Lightning Upgrade! Applying a single one of these to a Lightning Infuser will speed it up by a factor of 2, making it so every recipe takes 15 seconds instead of 30.
dj2.quest.db.277.title=Hardest, best, fastest, strongest
dj2.quest.db.277.desc=Upgrade your LE Transmitter and Receivers to Tier 3, the final tier! The LE Receiver will reduce the energy cost of recipes in the Lightningcraft Infusion Multiblock by 50%%.%n%n§6You only need to do one task.
dj2.quest.db.278.title=Shiny yet dark
dj2.quest.db.278.desc=Craft some Mystical Iron Ingots to finish up the LightningCraft progression!
dj2.quest.db.279.title=Back to the start
dj2.quest.db.279.desc=Wow, a lot of mobs inside! And it's very dark indeed.%n%nYour first goal should be to survive: Dig yourself a small tunnel right below ground, but WATCH OUT: there is NO BEDROCK LAYER at Y=0, so always watch your height level when mining below ground! Don't fall out of the world!%n%nYour tunnel should lead to nearby trees. There are 3 types of them in Vethea: Firewood, Hyrewood, and Mintwood. Find any of them and get some Logs. They don't drop any Saplings though, so you should be conservative.%n%nOnce you've collected some, make a Wooden Pickaxe Head.
dj2.quest.db.280.title=Nervously going to sleep...
dj2.quest.db.280.desc=Return home and craft a Nightmare Bed!%n%nMake a completely dark area (you can use Dark Ineffable Glass to keep the area dark while still being able to walk into it), and place the Bed inside. (Make sure to have at least a 2x2 area beside your Bed to spawn into when coming back.)%n%nSleeping in it will send you to Vethea, the Nightmare! Obviously, since it's a dream, you can't bring any of your items with you, and you can't bring any items out...%n%nOr can you?%n%nWith your technology, it might be possible. Make sure you have an Ender Chest outside of the Nightmare to send items to, then you'll only need to build an Ender Chest inside... How hard could it be...?%n%nThen, with the Ender Chest, you can send items back and forth! The most important items to send back are the various Pearls you can find by defeating mobs, and to make the Pearl farming easier, also send back Soul Vials with the mobs inside - to Powered Spawn them.
dj2.quest.db.281.title=Defeating the masses
dj2.quest.db.281.desc=Vethea has 4 layers, with different types of mobs spawning on each layer. To advance to the next layer, simply dig up! These mobs drop all the Pearls listed to the right, and the Acid Hag (spawning on the bottom two layers) drops Acid. Collect it all!%n%nNote: You probably want to prepare before heading up to the top layers, as mobs are increasingly more difficult. I would suggest creating a network of tunnels to travel between. Use ladders to your advantage!%n%nOnce you have access to Soul Vials (which you pretty much should, if you've completed this quest), also grab a mob from each layer to transfer back into the Overworld!
dj2.quest.db.282.title=Gotta catch them all
dj2.quest.db.282.desc=Use Sand, Lava, and Polished Pearls to create Soul Sand!%n%nUse Soul Sand, Glass, and any kind of Pearls to make a Soul Vial! Collect 4 types of mobs (1 from each layer) to later Powered Spawn them in your base for their loot!
dj2.quest.db.283.title=Hot stone to hot liquid
dj2.quest.db.283.desc=Find some Fire Crystals! There should be plenty in Vethea. You can use these to conjure Lava! Useful for powering a Tinkers' Construct Smeltery.

dj2.quest.db.285.title=Melon^3
dj2.quest.db.285.desc=Find some Dream Melons inside Chests in small Crypts on the bottom layer of Vethea, then craft it into vanilla Melon slices and Glistering Melon slices!
dj2.quest.db.286.title=You've Ventured for Power
dj2.quest.db.286.desc=Return from Vethea using the Portal located right where you spawned in.%n%nUsing a Dungeon Token, some Ignition (from the end of Bewitchment), an Impetus Crystal, Lightning Grenade (gathered from an Environmental Accumulator) and Clean Pearls you've just obtained craft some Lightning Charges! This will open LightningCraft for you!
dj2.quest.db.287.title=I like my Arcanium well done
dj2.quest.db.287.desc=Find an Arcanium Extractor inside the Dungeon. It can spawn in multiple different types of rooms.%n%nUse Raw Arcanium in the top slot and Collectors in the bottom slot to create Arcanium!

dj2.quest.db.288.desc=Throw a piece of Diamond, Gold Ingot, and Iron Ingot on the ground in the same spot, and (while highlighting a block) strike them with Lightning to transform them into a piece of Electricium Ingot!%n%nRinse and repeat 3 more times to complete the quest.
dj2.quest.db.289.title=Accelerating your Dreams
dj2.quest.db.289.desc=Find Datticon inside the Dungeon of Arcana and buy 3 Accelerons from her!%n%nThese will be used to accelerate your dreams and send you flying into the nightmare of Vethea...
dj2.quest.db.290.title=Red Lightning

dj2.quest.db.291.desc=...Then LightningCraft will!%n%nCraft some Ichor by striking Lightning on Demon Blood, a Skyfather Ingot, and an Emerald.%n%nYou no longer need to use your Club (you can if you want to), instead use the Lightning strikes generated by your Electrostatic Generators!
dj2.quest.db.292.title=Undercreeps would be proud
dj2.quest.db.292.desc=Use the Lightningcraft Infusion Multiblock to get Guard's Bone Meal, any Crusher to get Electricium Dust and the Underpowder you've gained from Powered Spawning Undercreeps to craft some Empowered Underpowder!

dj2.quest.db.294.desc=Defeat mobs inside the Dungeon to collect Collectors and become a Collector collector.
dj2.quest.db.295.title='Pop' - it comes out
dj2.quest.db.295.desc=Construct your Reactor and use it to produce Cyanite Ingots!%n%nIf you want to optimize Cyanite gain - and you will - you'll want to make your reactor as inefficient as possible. This means no coolant, having the rods spaced out so they are always 4 blocks away from the nearest rod in the X and Z direction (diagonally has no such restriction), and as big a reactor as possible!
dj2.quest.db.296.title=Yellorium in, Cyanite out
dj2.quest.db.296.desc=Craft one (or two) Access Ports for Yellorium input and Cyanite output. You can change it between Inlet and Outlet mode and insert Yellorium into one using an Export Bus, Item Conduit, etc., and extract Cyanite from the other one using an Import Bus, Item Conduit, etc.
dj2.quest.db.297.title=The Heart of the Reactor
dj2.quest.db.297.desc=Craft a Reactor Controller! This is where you can start and stop the reactor, and check how much RF it's producing.
dj2.quest.db.298.title=Burn it! BURN THE FUEL!
dj2.quest.db.298.desc=Craft some Fuel Rods and Control Rods to cap them off!
dj2.quest.db.299.title=It's got a Blue tone

dj2.quest.db.300.title=Limitless Enchanting Channelling Erebus
dj2.quest.db.300.desc=Craft an Enchantment Reallocator! This machine uses LE to transfer all Enchantments from the item placed into the top slot to the item placed into the bottom slot. There is no excuse for Protection III anymore!
dj2.quest.db.301.title=Special Room: Library
dj2.quest.db.301.desc=Find a special Library Room inside the Dungeon and use a Silk Touch tool to collect some Bookshelves! These will be used later on...
dj2.quest.db.302.title=Part of the Golden Club
dj2.quest.db.302.desc=Craft a Golden Club! You only need one, but you can make more if you want.%n%nBy swinging this in the air it uses up 2 durability to summon lightning! If you want to use it for anything useful (other than looks), then make sure to use it WHILE HOVERING OVER a block. This is required for LE (Lightning Energy) generation but lightning transformations can be done by other sources of lightning as well.
dj2.quest.db.303.title=Steel, ey!
dj2.quest.db.303.desc=Use your Blast Furnace to create some Steel!
dj2.quest.db.304.title=Zappy!
dj2.quest.db.304.desc=Gather the components to assemble the Lightningcraft Infusion Multiblock!%nIn addition to the listed components, you will need any Item Output Hatch, a Small or larger Item Input Hatch, and at least a Huge Energy Input Hatch.%n%nThis will allow you to process recipes faster and for higher output than the Lightningcraft Infuser, but more importantly, without the significant TPS lag the Infuser causes. It will also allow for additional recipes, such as the Mystic Ingot.%n%nThe Lightningcraft Infusion Multiblock can be upgraded:%n- By replacing the Skyfather Air Terminal atop the structure with an LE Reciever (Tier 3), the energy cost will be halved.%n- By replacing the Advanced Lightning Cell below the structure with a Mystic Lightning Cell, the processing speed will be doubled.%n- By instead replacing the Advanced Lightning Cell below the structure with an RF Lightning Generator, the processing speed will be 5 times faster!
dj2.quest.db.305.title=Dislocation Acquisition
dj2.quest.db.305.desc=Craft a Dislocator Receptacle and a couple pieces of Draconium Infused Obsidian!%n%nThese can all be arranged into the shape of a portal (either standing like a Nether Portal, or lying down like an End Portal). Make sure not to have the Dislocator Receptacle on a corner.%n%nTo link up 2 of such Portals, use 2 Dislocators. Shift+Right Click on one of them with one Dislocator, then Right Click on the other one to place it inside. Do the same with the other Dislocator on the other Portal if you'd like to travel both ways.%n%nThese portals can not only transfer you, the player, they also work on any entity - perfect to transport the Wither from a spawning place into a killing chamber, since the Wither floats down.%n%nThat still isn't all! They can also transmit RF power through Draconic Evolution Energy Crystals.%n%nWireless power, teleportation, and entity moving all in one multiblock. Amazing!
dj2.quest.db.306.title=Venturing? Again? For Power?
dj2.quest.db.306.desc=Find a Skeleton Guard Tower spawning rarely in the Underworld. Capture a Skeleton Guard and Powered Spawn it for its Bones!%n%nAdditionally, find some Undercreeps and defeat them to collect their Underpowder! You probably want to Powered Spawn these fellahs as well.
dj2.quest.db.307.title=No more Clubbing!
dj2.quest.db.307.desc=Make an Electrostatic Generator!%n%nThis is a powerful machine that can summon Lightning using two materials:%n%n- some LE Energy,%n- any kind of block (Cobblestone is probably the easiest).%n%nTo kick-start the process, place this next to a Lightning Cell, place a higher tier Air Terminal on top of the Cell, provide a constant stream of blocks to the Electrostatic Generator, and wait until Lightning strikes!%n%nThe Lightning will generate more LE than the Electrostatic Generator used, effectively creating free LE from just Cobblestone.%n%nYou can also place multiple Electrostatic Generators next to a single Lightning Cell to charge it even faster!
dj2.quest.db.308.title=The pack maker's favorite Ingot
dj2.quest.db.308.desc=What's darker than Steel?%n%n...%n%nA lot of things, actually. Like, I don't know, a spruce tree log, a lump of coal, a black hole, or my winter coat.%n%nBuuut this as well.
dj2.quest.db.309.title=Even better Air Terminal
dj2.quest.db.309.desc=Upgrade your Skyfather Air Terminal into a Mystic variant! This is the highest tier of Air Terminal.
dj2.quest.db.310.title=Locating the Totem
dj2.quest.db.310.desc=The Woodland Mansion Locator Token will find you the nearest Woodland Mansion!%nYou will need to kill the Evokers inside to get their Totems of Undying.%n%nAlternatively, you can summon Evokers via Root's Summoning Ritual!%n%n§6Note:§r If you're playing on a server that doesn't allow you to find or get to a Woodland Mansion, you will need to use the Ritual.%n%n§6Note:§r Only one of the two tasks has to be completed.
dj2.quest.db.311.title=Heart of "Gold"
dj2.quest.db.311.desc=Craft 10 Orange Heart Canisters. Drop these into your Heart Amulet and gain another 20 max HP!
dj2.quest.db.312.title=Seeing is power!
dj2.quest.db.312.desc=Craft a Network Visualization Tool! You'll need an activated Ender Core (Enhanced), for which you'll need to Right Click an End Crystal anywhere.%n%nThis Tool allows you to visualize your AE2 Network channels and connections by simply Right Clicking with it anywhere on your Network. It's especially helpful for visualizing where each P2P tunnel leads. For a pack that requires heavy automation through AE2, it's a very-very handy tool.
dj2.quest.db.313.title=Light the Flame
dj2.quest.db.313.desc=The Spectral Relay can be placed down to activate specific structures, and as a crafting ingredient.%n%nA common use is to collect Starlight for your Starlight Altars. For this you'll need to build a small structure: A 3x3 area with the corners being Chiseled Marble, the sides being Marble Arches, and the center being Sooty Marble. Place the Spectral Relay on top, and put a Glass Lens inside. The Crafting Altar closest to this structure (that isn't blocked by a wall) will receive significantly more Starlight.%n
dj2.quest.db.314.title="Foggy Glasses"
dj2.quest.db.314.desc=The Glass Lens is a crafting material and can be placed in specific blocks, such as a Relay, to cause special effects.
dj2.quest.db.315.title=Wood you believe it?
dj2.quest.db.315.desc=Toss some Glimmering Dreamwood into Liquid Starlight to get Infused Wood, a crafting material.
dj2.quest.db.316.title=Crafting with the Stars
dj2.quest.db.316.desc=Craft the Starlight Crafting Table!%n%nThis would normally require the light of a Collector Crystal, but not in this pack! You can just craft it in any Crafting Table.%n%n§6§lNote:§r Are you progressing in Astral Sorcery while your friend is doing other things? Make sure to craft the §lScroll of Written Expertise§r once you're done to transfer your discovered Astral Sorcery constellations to them!%n%n§6§lNote 2:§r DJ2 has the ability to right click an Astral Sorcery table and automatically unlock the knowledge for that tier. Normally, it requires either crafting that table manually, or using the aforementioned Scroll of Written Expertise.
dj2.quest.db.317.title=Theseus' Ship
dj2.quest.db.317.desc=Craft a Dislocator! Shift+Right Click to bind it to a place. Right Click to teleport to that base. Has twenty (20) uses.%nWhen placed on a Dislocator Pedestal, has infinite uses.%n%nAnd, if you have a moment to spare, consider how horrifying teleportation would be.
dj2.quest.db.318.title=Gniwolg
dj2.quest.db.318.desc=Nocturnal Powder will cause the block it is placed on to be covered by a dark cloud for a few seconds and spawn multiple mobs. Same as Illumination Powder, you can throw it.
dj2.quest.db.319.title=Glowing
dj2.quest.db.319.desc=Illumination Powder is primarily a crafting material, but also works as a light source when placed down. As it isn't a block, the only way to remove it is to smother it by covering it with a solid block.%n%nAlso you can throw it, it's very fun.
dj2.quest.db.320.title=Locked away forever
dj2.quest.db.320.desc=Just like the Lens, the PrismLens will redirect Starlight directed into it by a Linking Tool towards another location determined by the Linking Tool. Unlike the Lens, it can split Starlight among multiple points.
dj2.quest.db.321.title=SIIIIIIIIP
dj2.quest.db.321.desc=Toss some Sparkling Aquamarine into the Starlight Infuser and Right Click it with a Resonating Wand to craft Resonating Gems. Make sure that your Liquid Starlight isn't flowing.%n%nIt's only Resonating Gem if it's from the Resonating region in France. Otherwise it's just Sparkling Aquamarine.
dj2.quest.db.322.title=More than a Tank
dj2.quest.db.322.desc=Craft a Containment Chalice! On the surface, this is a tank that can hold up to 24 Buckets of fluid. But it can do sooo much more!%n%n1. You can simply pump Liquids in and out from the bottom with any kind of Liquid Pipe.%n%n2. When you place two of these Chalices close to each other, the Liquids inside start interacting with each other: Water + Lava will create Cobblestone, Stone, and sometimes Obsidian, Water, and Starlight will create Ice, Lava, and Starlight will create Sand and sometimes even Aquamarine Ore! You can collect these with an Absorption Hopper.%n%n3. Placing a Chalice next to a Lightwell will drain the Lightwell automatically. Perfect for automation!%n%n4. Placing a Chalice in the Starlight Infuser structure will allow you to directly pump Starlight into the Chalices for the ritual, without having to replace the small Starlight puddles. The Infuser will draw Starlight from nearby Chalices first, before it drains it from the pools.
dj2.quest.db.323.title=Astral Apex
dj2.quest.db.323.desc=Using your Enchanter's PhD, craft the Iridescent Altar. Just like its prior Starlight Altars, it gains more max Starlight, generates more natively, and gains more slots to craft with.%nIn addition to that, it also unlocks the ability to place an attuned crystal to specify a Constellation, which is required for many items.%nIt also unlocks the ability for crafts to require items placed on Spectral Relays after the craft is initialized. These are indicated by spectral versions of themselves displaying above the specific Spectral Relays.%n
dj2.quest.db.324.title=Draw 4
dj2.quest.db.324.desc=The Starlight Crafting Altar is the next tier of Starlight Altar. It can craft all the items that the Luminous Crafting Table can, but requires a multiblock structure to function. You can use a Sextant on it to see a spectral preview of the multiblock.%nIt has a higher amount of maximum Starlight, and gets more Starlight, meaning prior tier recipes will become easier to accomplish.%n%nThe Starlight Crafting Altar will replace your Luminous Crafting Table, so make sure everything you need to complete the upgrade is made.%n%nTo finish the quest, pickup the Altar so the quest book detects it.
dj2.quest.db.325.title=Demonic Portal
dj2.quest.db.325.desc=The Celestial Gateway is a multiblock structure that allows easy cross-dimensional teleportation! Simply place it down, assemble the structure (remember the Sextant shows a preview), do that in another place, and then look in the direction of the desired place. A star will appear, and by holding shift you can teleport over to the desired location. Once you have teleported once, a preview of the landscape on the other side will be displayed. Celestial Gateways can be renamed to further help navigation.%n%nAlso, 2 of them will be used for the final item in this Chapter.
dj2.quest.db.326.title=Dust not for ingestion
dj2.quest.db.326.desc=Process some Starmetal Ore and get both Stardust and Starmetal Ingots.
dj2.quest.db.327.title=Senior Astronomer
dj2.quest.db.327.desc=The final tier of Astral observation, the Observatory allows you to finally view Faint Constellations. Similar to the Looking Glass from long ago, to draw Constellations you must hold Shift to connect the stars.
dj2.quest.db.328.title=Praise the Gods
dj2.quest.db.328.desc=The Celestial Altar is the next tier of Starlight Altar. It can craft all the items that the Starlight Crafting Altar and Luminous Crafting Table could, but requires a larger multiblock structure to function. You can use a Sextant on it to see a spectral preview of the multiblock. The listed items only include additional materials you need to get to upgrade your previous Altar.%nIt has a higher amount of maximum starlight, and gets more starlight, meaning prior tier recipes will become easier to accomplish.%nThe Celestial Altar will replace your Starlight Crafting Altar, so make sure everything you need to complete the upgrade is made.%n%nTo finish this quest, pickup the central Altar so the quest book can detect it.
dj2.quest.db.329.title=Space Infused
dj2.quest.db.329.desc=First, craft a Ludicrite Block. Then, break it up into ingots and alloy it into Ludicrous Ore. Finally, using your Linking Tool, link a Starlight origin to a placed down Ludicrous Ore. This will eventually turn into Starmetal Ore.%n%nTo automate this, you simply need some Block Placers and Block Breakers on a timer. Since you'll use a lot of Starmetal, I recommend automating this immediately!
dj2.quest.db.330.title=A tunnel I meant
dj2.quest.db.330.desc=The Attunement Altar is a multiblock structure that will allow you to attune a large variety of things.%nTo specify what to attune to, place down Spectral Relays in the locations needed to form a Constellation. This is indicated by blue sparks when holding a Constellation Paper.%nThen, wait for that Constellation to be in the sky at night.%nThe nodes around the central Altar will lift up with the pure, channeled force of the Starlight.%nNow, toss an item that can be attuned, such as Rock Crystals or Celestial Crystals, onto the Altar.%n%nAlternatively, Attune yourself and unlock the powerful world of Perks! Experience will be gained based on what you attune yourself to. Experience required to level up has been modified by a custom formula via Astral Level Tweak, making early levels easy to obtain and keeping later levels feasible. The level cap is 100, so go wild and see what you can do.
dj2.quest.db.331.title=Look, Ma! Hands!
dj2.quest.db.331.desc=The Looking Glass requires a clear view of the sky, but will allow you to spot the Bright Constellations you've been gathering. These are indicated by a group of large and distinctive stars. Hold shift to freeze the Looking Glass in place, and connect the stars in the manner shown on the Constellation Papers. The stars that are relevant to a Constellation are visibly larger than irrelevant ones.
dj2.quest.db.332.title=Overgrad
dj2.quest.db.332.desc=The Stellar Refraction Table can give you Enchanted Books over the maximum vanilla level. Using Mending III, gained from Aevitas, Sharpness VII & Power VII, gained from Discidia, and Feather Falling, gained from Vicio, craft the Enchanter's PhD.%n%nYou've earned it.%n%n(These can be placed anywhere in the Crafting window, and the Books may have other enchantments on them.)
dj2.quest.db.333.title=Fractal Patterns
dj2.quest.db.333.desc=The Stellar Refraction Table will allow Constellations in the sky to empower what's on the board, using an Infused Glass. It does its magic on Potions and Enchantments, and it does its job extremely well. Its effect increases based on the number of overlapping stars on the Constellations placed down on the paper inside.%n%nFirst, you need it to be night.%nThen, Right Click Parchment and Infused Glass onto it.%nNext, move up to 3 Constellations onto the table. The Constellation matters for what effect it gives, which can be found in the Constellation tab of the Astral Tome.%nThis may fail, burning away the Parchment used, but if it succeeds you have gained an Engraved Glass.%n%nNow, Shift+Right Click to take the Engraved Glass out to inspect it - does it have the right effects?%nIf it does, put it back in, and Right Click a Potion, Book, Tool, Armor, or other enchantable items.%nIt will add the effects of the Engraved Glass onto the item at the cost of durability.%n%nHappy Infusing.%nHappy Engraving.%nHappy Enchanting.%nHappy Ending.
dj2.quest.db.334.title=Exchanger++
dj2.quest.db.334.desc=The Conversion Wand is a unique builders wand. Shift+Right Clicking on a block will add it to a list displayed in the top left. When used on a block it will replace an area of the target block with a random mix of blocks from the list! Left Click mid-air to clear the list.%nLike many Astral tools, holding it will display a blue shimmering bar overlaid on top of your experience bar. This indicates the tool's ability to work, and slowly recharges.
dj2.quest.db.335.title=What an Ore-deal!
dj2.quest.db.335.desc=After exploding some Mystical Iron Ingots into Shattered Mystical Iron Crystals, alloy it with Stone to create Rock Crystal Ore. This will give Rock Crystals when broken by a player.%n%nRock Crystals have a random Size, Cutting, and Purity when obtained. It's not going to be relevant until later, but higher stats are always better.%n%n(PS. Rock Crystal Ore does NOT generate normally, this is the only way to obtain it.)
dj2.quest.db.336.title=Modern Melter
dj2.quest.db.336.desc=The Lightwell produces various fluid outputs when an item has been placed in it. It must have access to the sky, and works faster at night. Fluids are produced at different amounts based on the item. They also have a shatter percentage, which is their chance to break.%n%nThe main function is to gather Liquid Starlight. In order of least Liquid Starlight to most Liquid Starlight per cycle: Sparkling Aquamarine, Resonating Gem, Rock Crystal, Attuned Rock Crystal, Celestial Crystal, and Attuned Celestial Crystal. Your only options right now are either Rock Crystals or Sparkling Aquamirines.%n%nIn order of highest break chance to lowest break chance: Sparkling Aquamarine, Resonating Gem, Rock Crystal, Celestial Crystal, Attuned Rock Crystal, and Attuned Celestial Crystal.%n%nAdditionally, placing the Lightwell in areas of high natural Starlight or focusing Starlight on the Lightwell via a Linking Tool will cause more fluid to be produced per cycle, leading to significant increases in efficiency.
dj2.quest.db.337.title=The Divining Rod That Works TM
dj2.quest.db.337.desc=The Fosic Resonator is the first of a multi-tier item that allows you to detect important information. For the first tier, it only allows you to see Starlight Fields at night, indicated by a glowing blue layer on the ground when held. Starlight Fields increase the amount of Starlight in a Crafting Altar, so if you're struggling getting enough Starlight at night, make sure to build your Crafting Altar at a high Starlight-concentration area.%n%nAlso, building your setup higher in elevation will also grant more Starlight.
dj2.quest.db.338.title=SLUUUUUP
dj2.quest.db.338.desc=Snag a bucket of Liquid Starlight. A Lightwell holds a maximum of two buckets.%nWill give you Night Vision if you stand in it.
dj2.quest.db.339.title=Heed the Heat
dj2.quest.db.339.desc=Craft a full set of Thermal Padding armor to defend against the extreme temperatures on Mars! Equip it in your Galacticraft inventory tab.
dj2.quest.db.340.title=Pick me, pick me not
dj2.quest.db.340.desc=The Shifting Star will completely reset your Perks - both their allocation, and all experience gained.%nLater, you can upgrade your Shifting Star to an Irradiant Star, which only resets their allocation, and keeps all experience and progress gained. Additionally, they reattune you to the specified Bright Constellation.%nTo use, simply hold Right Click for a few seconds as an animation plays.
dj2.quest.db.341.title=True and Absolute Beauty
dj2.quest.db.341.desc=Infuse Magical Leather for the epic and long anticipated next tier of extravagant Leather, which will dazzle your eyes and nourish your very soul.%nmeh
dj2.quest.db.342.title=Infuser 2... 3? 4??? point oh
dj2.quest.db.342.desc=The Starlight Infuser is a multiblock structure. The item to infuse is placed in the center, and then Right Clicked by a Resonating Wand. When the infusion is completed, there is a chance that a Liquid Starlight bucket has been consumed, and must be replaced to continue using the Starlight Infuser.%n%nTo automate this, you could setup a Mechanical User to Right Click if and only if the target block does not have a fluid source inside it. However, later you'll be able to automate it in a much simpler way: Once you have access to a Containment Chalice, the Starlight Infuser can directly pull Starlight from it provided it is within 4 blocks of the Infuser. Then you'll only need a Fluid Pipe of some sort to provide Liquid Starlight to the Chalice!
dj2.quest.db.343.title=Eagle Eye
dj2.quest.db.343.desc=The Telescope requires a clear view of the sky, and is placed down as opposed to being held. You can rotate through 8 different views, some of which may have Constellations on them, depending on what Constellations you know from the Constellation Papers you have gathered, and depending on the current moon phase. If you can't find any more Constellations, you might need to wait for the following night!%n%nThe Telescope can see both Bright and Dim Constellations, so 7 more than the simple Looking Glass.%n%nJust like the Looking Glass, you will need to connect the stars in the manner shown on the Constellation Papers to learn more about them.
dj2.quest.db.344.title=Need glasses?
dj2.quest.db.344.desc=The Lens will redirect all Starlight directed into it by a Linking Tool towards another location determined by the Linking Tool.
dj2.quest.db.345.title=U&Me
dj2.quest.db.345.desc=The Linking Tool will allow you to link Starlight producers, transmitters, and collectors together. To link, Right Click on the origin, then Right Click on the target. To unlink, Shift+Right Click on the origin. To stop selecting the origin, switch it out of your hand. An origin targeting multiple locations will evenly split across all of them, if possible.
dj2.quest.db.346.title=Wand of the Scrambled Builder
dj2.quest.db.346.desc=The Formation Wand is a unique builders wand. Shift+Right Clicking on a block will add it to a list displayed in the top left. When used on a distant block, it will build towards you, placing them in a random mix of blocks from the list!

This indicates the tool's ability to work, and slowly recharges.
dj2.quest.db.347.title=Astral Actuator
dj2.quest.db.347.desc=Craft a Resonating Wand! This Wand is used to finish all Astral Sorcery crafts. Once you have the required items laid out in a Luminous Crafting Table or Altar, Right Click with the Wand to activate the craft.
dj2.quest.db.348.title=Of Deepest Blue
dj2.quest.db.348.desc=Toss a Stardust and a Rock Crystal into a pool of Liquid Starlight. After a few seconds, they will be consumed and replaced by a Celestial Crystal Cluster. This will slowly grow, until eventually it will emit white glimmering particles. When broken in this state, it will drop a Celestial Crystal of random stats and 2 Stardust.%n%nThis process can be sped up by placing Starmetal Ore beneath the Celestial Crystal Cluster - while its growing, the ore has a chance to convert back into Ludicrous Ore. If Starmetal Ore is below the the Celestial Crystal when it is broken, its final stat purity stat will be increased, and there is a chance to drop a second Celestial Crystal.%n%nCelestial Crystals have the same 3 stats as Rock Crystals, but instead of going up to Size 400, they go all the way up to size 900!
dj2.quest.db.349.title=Glowstick
dj2.quest.db.349.desc=A reusable source of placing Illumination Powder! It can be colored by placing it with a dye in the crafting grid. Using a colored Illumination Wand on a Cave Illuminator will cause all lights that will be placed by the Cave Illuminator to be the same color as the Illumination Wand's.
dj2.quest.db.350.title=Revealing the Stars!
dj2.quest.db.350.desc=Use your Astral Core to craft a Star of Revelation! This Star reveals the truth about the universe for you... Is there something outside? All this time you've been looking up at the night sky, finding Constellations, using the power of Moonlight, and being truly mesmerized... Is it a place you could someday reach?%n%n...%n%nYou ponder.%n%nMaybe we can visit it....%n%n...Personally.
dj2.quest.db.351.title=Heart of the Stars
dj2.quest.db.351.desc=Using your recently identified Faint Constellations, Attune 4 Celestial Crystals, one to each of the 4 Faint Constellations, and craft them with a Resplendent Prism.%nTo Attune Faint Constellations to Celestial Crystals, they need to already be attuned to a Bright or Dim Constellation.
dj2.quest.db.352.title=Sunlight, Sunbright, Oh Sun You Are My Star "Tonight"
dj2.quest.db.352.desc=The Celestial Collector Crystal is far more powerful at gathering Starlight than the normal Collector Crystal. However, to function, it needs a structure to channel this power. Liquid Starlight will never be consumed from this structure, unlike the Starlight Infuser.%nRemember to Link it to a Lens, Prism, or Starlight Altar with the Linking Tool, otherwise it won't help you!%n%nThis will finally allow you to generate enough Starlight for your Starlight Altar for you to be able to craft during the day!%n...provided you use a Crystal with higher Purity and Size than 1%% and 1. Those stats matter, you know! §5Sucks to be Cutting, though, totally useless here.§r
dj2.quest.db.353.title=Roulette
dj2.quest.db.353.desc=When crafted, it will gain traits that will increase specific enchantments. Its effects are only active when equipped in the Amulet slot. It can be re-rolled to try to get better effects.%n%nThis is called gambling. May the rolls be with you.
dj2.quest.db.354.title=Going Galactic!
dj2.quest.db.354.desc=Craft some Galactic Ingots with your Star of Revelation to unlock Galacticraft!%n%nNote: This does NOT use up the Star of Revelation, however AE2 is not too well-informed, and it eats up the Star anyway. Use an external crafter (like an RFTools Crafter) if you want to automate the creation of Galactic Ingots!
dj2.quest.db.355.title=DOMINATING
dj2.quest.db.355.desc=The Domic Resonator is a direct upgrade to the Fosic Resonator. It adds another mode, which can be toggled between. This mode displays the area of Starlight a single absorber, such as a Collector Crystal, consumed. Competing Starlight absorbers will have reduced effectiveness.

dj2.quest.db.356.title=Structure Projector
dj2.quest.db.356.desc=When Right Clicked on the focal block of a structure, the Sextant will display a phantom of the structure to help you build it.%n%n(When Right Clicked elsewhere, it will open a star map. Now this would normally help you find Astral Sorcery structures, buuuuut these structures have been disabled in this pack. Sorry!)
dj2.quest.db.357.title=Light the way
dj2.quest.db.357.desc=When placed down, it will slowly place Illumination Powder in any place that doesn't have sky access and isn't lit up. It has quite the range, being able to light up a huge area of the caves below ground. Remember, Illumination Powder can be removed by smothering it with a block.
dj2.quest.db.358.title=Starlight acquisition acceleration modification
dj2.quest.db.358.desc=Since Astral Sorcery structures are disabled, there needs to be a way to craft a Collector Crystal. This method is pretty expensive, and gives you a decent Crystal, but soon upcoming methods will make this much cheaper.%n%nNonetheless, craft this specific Collector Crystal in your 7x7 Elite Crafting Table, and place it in a location.%n%nIf directed towards a Starlight Altar, it will increase the Starlight within it, making crafting easier - and potentially letting small crafts occur during the day!
dj2.quest.db.359.title=Astronomy is my favorite subject
dj2.quest.db.359.desc=Craft some Constellation Papers! (These can no longer be found in the world.) They grant you knowledge about the exact look of each Astral Sorcery Constellation. You'll need more than 3, this is just to get you started. Overall there are 16 Constellations: 5 Bright, 7 Dim and 4 Faint. Each Constellation Paper should give you a unique one, so you won't have to craft more than 16 of these.%n%nLater you'll be able to craft each specific Constellation Paper, and they'll be slightly less expensive too.%n%nWhile this isn't §otechnically§o§r required for any quest, you need to discover every Constellation to complete this page. Better get cracking!
dj2.quest.db.360.title=Fly like an Angel
dj2.quest.db.360.desc=The Flügel Tiara is cool an' all, but you constantly need to refill it. Wouldn't it be better to use something that doesn't constantly lose its charge?! Well, your Astral studies have paid off: You can craft an Angel Ring now! There are 6 types, but they only differ in looks.%n%nMake sure to have enough GP to use it and feel free to place it in your Bauble Ring slot.
dj2.quest.db.361.title=Fusion Crafting
dj2.quest.db.361.desc=Set up Fusion Crafting! Place the Fusion Crafting Core in the middle, and place the 9 Fusion Crafting Injectors nearby. Note that some recipes take more than 9 Crafting Injectors, but 9 is a good number to start with.%n%nYou'll need to power each Crafting Injector, and place the central item in each recipe in the Crafting Core and the outer item in the Injectors.%n%nEventually you'll NEED to automate this machine (preferably one of the higher tier ones). You can do this with Actually Additions Item Lasers.%n%n1. You'll first need to set up an Item Interface from Actually Additions next to an AE2 Interface that is on Blocking Mode.%n%n2. Then place a Laser on the Item Interface making sure that all sides of the Laser either touch the Item Interface or air only.%n%n3. Now set up the Fusion Injectors around the Fusion Crafting Core and keep the Injectors on Single Item Mode so that only one item gets inserted into each Injector.%n%n4. Put Item Lasers connecting to all Injectors from any side of the Laser. This means you can share an Item Laser between multiple Injectors if you want.%n%n5. Then place a Laser on the Fusion Core making sure that all sides of the Item Laser only touch the Core or air, and set the Laser to a priority of 1 by Right Clicking on it once with a Compass.%n%n6. Apply a redstone signal to the Crafting Core with a Redstone Clock or similar to let the crafts automatically start.%n%n7. Connect all Lasers with the Laser Wrench and use any pipes you want to extract the output of the Crafting Core into your ME System making sure that the pipes do not connect to the Item Lasers.%n%n8. Lastly, hook up the Interface to your ME System and power the Injectors: you are now ready to start crafting!%n%n%nNote that when you make the Pattern for crafts for Fusion Crafting, the center item needs to be in the upper left slot in the Pattern Terminal, and the other ingredients can go anywhere. Just pulling the recipe from JEI will put the items where they need to go.
dj2.quest.db.362.title=Chunks not chunky enough yet
dj2.quest.db.362.desc=We're closing in on the lategame... And so far, with the default settings, you only had 50 Chunks you were able to load. This changes to today! You need more Chunks to load, I know you do: Introducing the Chunk Loading Ward! Simply place it down inside a Chunk, and it'll be forever loaded!%n%nMany servers will disable this, but even if they don't, check with your server owner to make sure using them is okay.
dj2.quest.db.363.title=More machinery
dj2.quest.db.363.desc=Now these items could have been crafted before you reached Mars, you didn't need them yet. So once you return, craft 5 Ambient Thermal Controllers and upgrade them later with Martian materials.
dj2.quest.db.364.title=The God of War, the Red Planet
dj2.quest.db.364.desc=Fly to Mars! Your landing will be softer thanks to the Tier 2 Rocket, so you won't even need to hold Space this time.
dj2.quest.db.365.title=Satellite Foresight
dj2.quest.db.365.desc=Craft a Satellite Controller and a Communications Dish Card. Then Right Click the Dish Card onto the base of a Communications Dish and the Satellite Controller itself, and power the Controller from the top.%n%nIf the Communications Dish can find a Satellite in orbit, you'll be able to contact it to discover all the planets in order.%n%nOnce you've sent a Satellite into orbit, keep the Controller powered, and check back on it regularly. Maybe it has discovered a planet you can go to!
dj2.quest.db.366.title=It's the 21st century!
dj2.quest.db.366.desc=Build a Basic Satellite! You'll need additional infrastructure to send it up into space and contact it...
dj2.quest.db.367.title=Fabricate, Locate, and Communicate
dj2.quest.db.367.desc=Craft a Communications Dish. This machine is used to locate Satellites you've launched into space. It is also used as a crafting ingredient.
dj2.quest.db.368.title=Better Plates!
dj2.quest.db.368.desc=Craft some Tier 2 Heavy-Duty Plates!%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%nI swear they're better and not just more expensive...! Trust me!
dj2.quest.db.369.title=Moon Bombardment Beneficiator
dj2.quest.db.369.desc=Obtain some Meteoric Iron! This is normally done by seeking some Fallen Meteors on the surface of the Moon, however that can be slow and tedious. Because of this, an alternative recipe has been added that you might want to use.
dj2.quest.db.370.title=Process, Compress, but Repossess nonetheless
dj2.quest.db.370.desc=Craft some Compressed materials. I would recommend setting up separate Compressors for each of the items listed.
dj2.quest.db.371.title=Volume Shrinker
dj2.quest.db.371.desc=Make a Compressor and immediately upgrade it to an Electric Compressor!%n%nThis machine can make various Compressed and Heavy-Duty materials, and is vital to automate it immediately. It's a bit slow, but you'll be able to craft an extremely fast version of this machine with the Ultimate Compressor, a Modular Machine only available after visiting the Moon. Until then, make a bunch of Electric Compressors and CONSTANTLY keep crafting the requirements for Heavy-Duty Plates. Don't think you can get away with only making Compressors instead of the Electric Compressors, either - they can't be automated!%n%n§6§6Remember that Galacticraft machines only accept power from the side with the green dot!
dj2.quest.db.372.title=Breathe!
dj2.quest.db.372.desc=Craft some Heavy Oxygen Tanks! To fill them, place them into the bottom right slot of the Oxygen Compressor. Make sure to equip them in your Galacticraft inventory.%n%nWhen on a planet that lacks Oxygen, a graphic on the top right of your HUD will show up, letting you know how much Oxygen you have left.
dj2.quest.db.373.title=O2
dj2.quest.db.373.desc=Craft an Oxygen Collector and an Oxygen Compressor.%n%n1. Place the Oxygen Collector near some leaves (these can be natural or placed down), power it through the green dot on the side, and let it collect some Oxygen.%n%n2. Place the Oxygen Compressor on the side with the black dot to transfer the collected Oxygen to it. Power it through its green dot as well.%n%n3. Now you can place an Oxygen Tank in the bottom right slot to fill it up with Oxygen.%n%nYou can also craft an Oxygen Storage Module to store some Oxygen. That way the filling process could be faster.
dj2.quest.db.374.title=My favorite type of Biscuit
dj2.quest.db.374.desc=Make all 4 types of Galacticraft Wafers that are available at this point.%n%nIt'll become useful if you immediately automate them with one or more Circuit Fabricators.
dj2.quest.db.375.title=What starts as black and becomes yellow after refining?!
dj2.quest.db.375.desc=Craft a Refinery! You can power it from the top, push Oil in from the left, and pull Fuel out on the right.
dj2.quest.db.376.title=Going Heavy
dj2.quest.db.376.desc=Make some Compressed Bronze and create your first Heavy-Duty Plates! Since this material will be used a LOT throughout Galacticraft, I highly recommend setting up a separate Compressor for it, and later fully automating it.
dj2.quest.db.377.title=Expanding your reach
dj2.quest.db.377.desc=Craft a Tier 3 Rocket and obtain the Research Paper for Venus from your Satellite Controller!%n%nThis Tier of Rocket will be capable of bringing you to both Venus AND the Asteroid Belt, the final two Galacticraft dimensions available in the pack. %n%nBefore traveling to Venus, make sure you have all items listed in the Tier 1 Rocket quest. Additionally, you'll need to bring a Bucket and a Fluid container again, as well as your §cIsothermal Armor§f and §cShears§f.
dj2.quest.db.378.title=More Loot! Rockin' it.
dj2.quest.db.378.desc=Use the Tier 2 Dungeon Key you've obtained from the Evolved Creeper Boss to open the final Chest at the end of the Dungeon. You could either find the Schematic for the Automatic Cargo Rocket or the Tier 3 Rocket. You (again) need the latter, and they are (again) convertible into each other.
dj2.quest.db.379.title=Tier 3 Rocket components
dj2.quest.db.379.desc=Craft all the items listed to the right for a Tier 3 Rocket!
dj2.quest.db.380.title=Preparing for Venus
dj2.quest.db.380.desc=Craft a full set of Isothermal Armor! Equipping these in your Galacticraft inventory will make your character immune to extreme heats or extreme colds. Like Venus! Did you know that the surface temperature of Venus is about 475 °C or 900 °F? Yay!
dj2.quest.db.381.title=Sine and Cosine
dj2.quest.db.381.desc=Craft a Frequency Module! When equipped in your Galacticraft inventory, you'll be able to hear MUCH better in space. It's also used as a crafting ingredient.
dj2.quest.db.382.title=Fewl
dj2.quest.db.382.desc=Refine some Oil into Galacticraft Fuel.%n%nAlso craft an Empty Canister and Right Click a container to fill it up with Fuel. Keep this on you, you might need it to return from a planet if something goes wrong. You don't wanna get stranded!
dj2.quest.db.383.title=Introducing Ecological Collapse
dj2.quest.db.383.desc=Use your Liquicrafter to create some Oil!%n%nYou'll need 1 Bucket of Actually Additions Empowered Oil, 1 Bucket of Thermal Expansion Tree Oil, and 1 Basic Wafer.%n%nNote: Galacticraft Oil appears as 2 different items in JEI. However both of them can be used for the exact same thing. This is because Galacticraft doesn't actually use the Forge Liquid API like literally every other mod. Wonderful! If your quest isn't completing, then simply place down the Oil and pick it back up to convert it.
dj2.quest.db.384.title=Sapphires go whoosh
dj2.quest.db.384.desc=Craft a couple Sapphire Accelerators. These are components used for the Tier 2 Rocket.
dj2.quest.db.385.title=Don't be too cheesy
dj2.quest.db.385.desc=Craft some Cheesy Wafers! Make sure to automate it!
dj2.quest.db.386.title=Shiny blue rocks! (No, not Diamonds...)
dj2.quest.db.386.desc=Find some Sapphire Ore underground on the Moon! Or, you know, just use your Quarry.
dj2.quest.db.387.title=Wait WHAT? Aliens?!
dj2.quest.db.387.desc=Find a red structure poking out on the Martian surface and head down further into its corridors! You'll need some kind of teleportation like Ender Pearls or a Staff of Travelling to get to the final loot room. Loot some Secret Aliens Technology!%n%nThen obtain some Bacterial Sludge from underground. Although the quest only asks for one, you'll need 5 Buckets of it to upgrade your Ambient Thermal Controllers.%n%n§6Note:§r Galacticraft doesn't fully support the Forge liquid system, so there are actually two unique Bacterial Sludge Bucket items. Because of this, this quest has 2 Tasks for the 2 different Buckets, but you only need to complete one of them.
dj2.quest.db.388.title=Emplatification
dj2.quest.db.388.desc=Craft some Tier 3 Heavy-Duty Plates! They're eeeeeven better than the Tier 2 variants. Hurray!
dj2.quest.db.389.title=It's always sunny in Phila- I mean on Venus
dj2.quest.db.389.desc=Loot all 12 Fragments of the Sun from the Treasure Room inside the maze!
dj2.quest.db.390.title=Weeeeee! (-nus)
dj2.quest.db.390.desc=Here we are! Venus. What a wonderf- Is that ACID RAIN? ... And why is it so HOT!? Ugh, I hate this place...
dj2.quest.db.391.title=Put on your workshoes
dj2.quest.db.391.desc=Craft a couple Single Solar Modules and combine them into a Full Solar Panel. You'll need 24 of the latter for a working Satellite, but as you can automate almost every part of the process (other than the Compressed materials), your ME System will happily do the job for you! Make sure to set up the required automation now. Go!
dj2.quest.db.392.title=Awww, it isn't made out of cheese?
dj2.quest.db.392.desc=If you've made all the preparations, enter your Tier 1 Rocket and press Space to launch. Once you reach a high enough altitude, the map of the solar system opens up. Select the Earth and then select the Moon, and press "Launch" on the top right.%n%nMake sure to hold spacebar when entering the Moon's orbit, otherwise you'll crash your Rocket. That wouldn't be great now, would it.%n%nYou can recover your Rocket and your Launch Pads after safely landing.
dj2.quest.db.393.title=TO THE MOON!
dj2.quest.db.393.desc=Craft a Tier 1 Rocket and 9 Rocket Launch Pads. Place down the Launch Pads in a 3x3 formation. If correctly assembled, the central square should pop up a bit. Place the Rocket on top and Fuel it up with your Fuel Loader.%n%n§c§lBUT BEFORE YOU GO!§f%n%nYou need to make sure you can return, otherwise you WILL get stranded on the Moon. Even if you die, you'll respawn on the Moon again. To do this either take your Fuel Loader with you, or bring along some teleportation technology - choose from between EnderIO, Quantum Flux, Mekanism, and Astral Sorcery!%nIf you ever get stuck out in space, /home, /spawn, and /gchouston should all be able to take you back, but they should make you feel like a dirty cheater! >:D%n%nSO READ THIS CHECKLIST BEFORE YOU GO:%n%n1. Have you discovered the Moon in your Planet Progression Telescope? If not, check the previous quests.%n%n2. Fuel up your Rocket to the maximum. (if you are doing the intended route, §cremember to bring the Fuel Loader and a power source with you§f).%n%n3. Make sure you have your full Oxygen apparatus on you. This includes: an Oxygen Mask, an Oxygen Gear, two full Heavy Oxygen Tanks, and a Parachute. If you don't have the Parachute, you'll die upon landing.%n%n4. Bring an additional Filled Fuel Canister and an additional Empty Canister. You might need to move some Fuel around to return.%n%n5. Bring a Dungeon Locator, if you don't want to spend HOURS looking for an underground Dungeon.%n%n6. A Frequency Module is technically optional, but without it you won't be able to hear much of anything on a planet without an atmosphere.%n%n7. Bring some Food, Armor, and Weapons.%n%n8. Bring an RFTools Builder with a Shape Card Quarry, a power source and an inventory to place items into. A Dimensional Transceiver or an Ender Chest is the best option. You'll need a bunch of Ores and Rocks from the Moon, so might as well not do it manually.
dj2.quest.db.394.title=Can't see underground?
dj2.quest.db.394.desc=Craft a Dungeon Locator! This is normally a tool usable only in Creative mode, but since underground Galacticraft dungeons can be really difficult to find, it's available to craft in this pack. Make good use of it on the Moon, Mars, and Venus.
dj2.quest.db.395.title=Twolescope
dj2.quest.db.395.desc=Craft a Telescope! This time you'll use it to discover planets, not stars.%n%nOnce your Satellite Controller is done researching, it'll spit out a Moon Research Paper. Put this in the top slot and power the Telescope with a Mekanism Energy Tablet while it does its research! Once it's done, you'll locate the exact position of the Moon and unlock the ability to travel to it!
dj2.quest.db.396.title=Higher! Yes! Hiiiiiiigheeeeerrr!

dj2.quest.db.398.title=IT IS MADE OUT OF CHEESE!
dj2.quest.db.398.desc=Find some Cheese Ore underground on the Moon! Or, you know, just use your Quarry.
dj2.quest.db.399.title=Welcome to 7x7 machines, I hope you'll enjoy your stay!
dj2.quest.db.399.desc=Make a Circuit Fabricator!%n%nAlthough the quest only asks for one, you might want to make more, for faster speed. You can automatically input items from the top (they'll go into the right slots), and pull the output from the bottom.%n%nIt's also important to note that most Galacticraft machines can ONLY be powered from the left side, where the green dot is. If you automate this with AE2 Autocrafting, make sure to have the Silicon Wafers when you make the pattern in different slots.
dj2.quest.db.400.title=Framing the Stars
dj2.quest.db.400.desc=Craft some Tough Galactic Plating. I recommend setting up a couple Alloy Smelters with at least Melodic Capacitors to produce them passively, since you'll need a LOT of these going forward.%n%nThen use them and your Galactic Ingots to craft your first Galactic Machine Frame!
dj2.quest.db.401.title=Flying Space-Observer Constructor
dj2.quest.db.401.desc=Craft a Satellite Builder! This machine requires power input from the top.%n%nBefore you can visit any of the planets in person, you'll need to locate them, learn their orbit, and plot your trajectory. The Planet Progression mod does exactly this! You'll send up a Satellite into orbit, contact it, and slowly locate each of the available planets in order.
dj2.quest.db.402.title=The brain of the operation
dj2.quest.db.402.desc=Craft a Basic Satellite Module! The quest only asks for one, but you'll need 6 for a complete Satellite.

dj2.quest.db.403.desc=Craft a Tier 2 Rocket in your NASA Workbench and obtain the Research Paper for Mars from your Satellite Controller! Make sure to discover Mars before attempting to travel to it.%n%nBefore you launch, make sure again that everything is alright. If you're doing the intended way, you might want to bring even more fuel, 3 Filled Fuel Canisters will do.%nAdditionally, you'll need at least 1 empty Bucket and a Tank that can store at least 5 Buckets of Liquid. %n%nRead the Tier 1 Rocket quest "TO THE MOON!" again if you're unsure if you're missing something.
dj2.quest.db.404.title=Cool Moon Loot. Woot!
dj2.quest.db.404.desc=Insert the Key into the Tier 1 Dungeon Reward located behind the boss room. This might contain one of two Schematics: The Moon Buggy or the Tier 2 Rocket Schematic. You're looking for the latter, but fortunately even if you were unlucky and got the Moon Buggy Schematic, you can convert it into the one you need by crafting.
dj2.quest.db.405.title=Tier 1 Rocket parts
dj2.quest.db.405.desc=Craft a Nose Cone, 4 Rocket Fins and a Tier 1 Rocket Engine. These are the main components for a Tier 1 Rocket.

dj2.quest.db.408.desc=Obtain some Solar Ore from underground; some Volcanic Rock from around Lava pool, and near (or underneath) Volcanos; and at least 8 Buckets worth of Sulphuric Acid.%n%nThe easiest way to find Sulphuric Acid is to locate Vapor Spout blocks on ground level - a Sulphuric Acid pool will be right below. Alternatively, use the Roots Light Drifter spell and drift underground to spot them.%n%nIf you're low on Sulphuric Acid, you can duplicate the Liquid with some AbyssalCraft Crystallized Sulfur Clusters in the Liquicrafter.%n%n§6Note:§r Galacticraft doesn't fully support the Forge liquid system, so there are actually two unique Sulphuric Acid Bucket items. Becuase of this, this quest has 2 Tasks for the 2 different Buckets, but you only need to complete one of them.
dj2.quest.db.409.title=RF to Lightning
dj2.quest.db.409.desc=Enough with the Lightning strikes!%n%nWith the RF Lightning Generator, you can convert RF directly into LE!%nYou can also increase the speed of your Lightningcraft Infusion Multiblock by x5 compared to the base.
dj2.quest.db.410.title=Underground Moon Dungeon
dj2.quest.db.410.desc=Find an Underground Moon Dungeon, enter it, and get to the end. Defeat the Evolved Skeleton Boss to obtain the Tier 1 Dungeon Key.%n%nIf you have a Dungeon Locator, it will point you to the nearest one, likely saving you a significant amount of time searching.
dj2.quest.db.411.title=Crystal Eyes
dj2.quest.db.411.desc=Craft some Crystaltine Ingots with your new acquired Plasma Cores!%n%nThey are a pain to craft manually... But wait, the next quest might be able to help you on that.
dj2.quest.db.412.title=Loading...
dj2.quest.db.412.desc=Craft a Fuel Loader! When placed on the left side of a Launch Pad, and powered from the left, you can fill a Rocket on top of the Launch Pad.%n%nTo insert fuel, you'll need to use the right side, where the Launch Pad is normally. It's simplest to do this with a Phantomface.
dj2.quest.db.413.title=Breathing in space
dj2.quest.db.413.desc=Craft and equip an Oxygen Mask, an Oxygen Gear, and a Parachute. These will be vital to survive out in space, and vital to come back and land without dying.
dj2.quest.db.414.title=Satellite Flooring
dj2.quest.db.414.desc=Craft 25 Satellite Launch Pads and assemble them into a 5x5 square. When correctly assembled, the middle square should pop up.
dj2.quest.db.415.title=S-O-L-A-R
dj2.quest.db.415.desc=Use your Liquicrafter to process the Solar Ores you collected into Empowered Solar Dust and Solar Ingots!
dj2.quest.db.416.title=Your first Rocket!
dj2.quest.db.416.desc=Craft a Satellite Rocket! This is what you can use to send a Satellite into space:%n%n1. Place the Satellite Rocket onto the 5x5 Satellite Launch Pad.%n%n2. Place the Fuel Loader on the left of it to load some fuel into it. You'll need to power the Fuel Loader from the left.%n%n3. Right Click the Satellite Rocket and place a Satellite into it.%n%n4. Launch the Satellite Rocket. Your Satellite will be correctly sent into space!%n%n5. Now you can use your Satellite Controller and Communications Dish to connect to the Satellite.
dj2.quest.db.417.title=This job pays well IRL
dj2.quest.db.417.desc=Make a NASA Workbench! This is used to build all your Rockets. For now, only the Tier 1 Rocket and the Satellite Rocket are available. To unlock more Schematics, you'll need to find them on the Moon, Mars, or Venus. To do so, scroll to the last page, insert the Schematic and press "Unlock Schematic".%n%n(If you can't click on the buttons on the left because JEI is interfering, you can press Ctrl+O to disable JEI temporarily. Press it again to re-enable it.)%n%nMost Rockets can have an inventory. Simply insert Chests in the top right when building the Rocket to add some.
dj2.quest.db.418.title=IMA FIRIN' MAH LAZER
dj2.quest.db.418.desc=Craft all the components for the Laser Focus multiblock listed on the right! You can use larger Input, Output, and Energy input Hatches.%n%nThis machine focuses a laser beam at the input item to plasmafy it, charging it with a LOT of power... Good thing Portions of the Sun can transfer such energy, and Hyperglued Meteoric Casing can sustain it...!%n%nYou'll also need Mekanism Laser Energy, inputted near the tip of the Focus. You can easily convert RF into Mekanism Laser Energy using a Mekanism Laser. To charge the Mekanism Laser Acceptor faster, you can use all 4 sides. To make it EVEN faster, you can combine up to 5 Mekanism Laser beams into 1 stronger one using a Laser Amplifier.
dj2.quest.db.419.title=It makes the Asteroid as strong as possible
dj2.quest.db.419.desc=Craft a block of Hyperglued Meteoric Casing!%n%nThe central point of this block is very strong and can sustain any sort of pressure...
dj2.quest.db.420.title=Crafting with Liquids
dj2.quest.db.420.desc=Obtain the required materials listed on the right, and assemble them into a Liquicrafter Modular Machine multiblock.%n%nYou can use larger Input and Output Hatches, and you can use any kind of Conduit to import liquids and items into the Hatches on the left, and output them from the right.%n%nThis machine can combine liquids and items into other liquids and items, and it'll be used for some recipes from now on.%n%nThe first recipe you'll need it for is Galacticraft Oil, to be able to fuel your Rockets that you want to send to space.
dj2.quest.db.421.title=Quarrying some Desh, Deshing some Quarry
dj2.quest.db.421.desc=Obtain some Desh Ore from Mars. I recommend quarrying the place again.
dj2.quest.db.422.title=To the Asteroid Belt!
dj2.quest.db.422.desc=After researching the Asteroid Belt, fly there with your Tier 3 Rocket!%n%nPreparations include the same items as before. You won't need a Fluid container this time.
dj2.quest.db.423.title=To the underground again!
dj2.quest.db.423.desc=Find an Underground Mars Dungeon, enter it, and get to the end. Defeat the Creeper Boss! You can only do this by reflecting its projectiles back at it, similarly to how you would do to Ghasts in the Nether.%n%nIf you have a Dungeon Locator, it will point you to the nearest one, likely saving you a significant amount of time searching.
dj2.quest.db.424.title=Underground one final time
dj2.quest.db.424.desc=Locate the underground Venus Dungeon using your Dungeon Locator! Get to the end and defeat the Spider Queen boss! Use some Shears to cut off some of her special string.

dj2.quest.db.425.title=Parts of it still orbit the Sun to this day...
dj2.quest.db.425.desc=Find a special Meteor that's lit up from the top and built of unbreakable blue rocks! Head inside and discover that this is actually a Puzzle Meteor. Solve the 4 puzzles inside to gain 4 Key Fragments and head down to defeat the Asteroid Keeper! It drops 5 Chunks of Meteor that Ended the Era of Dinosaurs!
dj2.quest.db.426.title=Strong, like Titan
dj2.quest.db.426.desc=Find some Ilmenite Ore in the Asteroids dimension. It's pretty rare but spawns in large veins inside of asteroids. It's best to use a Digital Miner to locate some. Once you obtained some, process the Titanium Shards into Titanium Ingots.%n%nIf you use Silk Touch you get Ilmenite Ore directly, which has a more efficient conversion to Titanium Ingots.%n%nThe quest only asks for 10, but you'll need more eventually, so also set up a Quarry here.

dj2.quest.db.434.title=Oneshotting Withers
dj2.quest.db.434.desc=Make a Draconic Evolution Mob Grinder!%n%nWhen powered, it's even capable of destroying the Wither with a single blow. Use this to your advantage and build a Wither killer machine! Summon the Wither using Wither Builders (or Formation Planes, Block Placers, your choice). Make sure it stays inside a Witherproof enclosement, and wait for its invulnerability to wear off. Then kill it with a Mob Grinder (it even works through the Witherproof wall)!%n%nIt's also important to mention that the Wither CAN destroy your Wither Builder or other machines that aren't protected by Witherproof blocks. Popular solutions include:%n%n- letting the Wither fall in a tall chamber while its invulnerability wears off, and killing it at the bottom.%n%n- using Draconic Evolution portals made out of a Dislocator Receptacle and some Draconium Infused Obsidian, and teleporting the Wither away from your precious machines into another chamber with the Mob Grinder next to the outer walls; this design takes up less space but is more expensive.
dj2.quest.db.435.title=Biggerer Battery

This is the highest tier Flux Capacitor available in the pack.%n%nCharge it up in your Thermal Expansion Energetic Infuser or Draconic Evolution Energy Infuser.%n%nShift+Right Click with it to toggle it between multiple modes. You can also equip this in a Bauble slot or just leave it in your inventory to charge your desired items.
dj2.quest.db.436.title=Oh, Packers!
dj2.quest.db.436.desc=Craft a Packager! You'll only need one Packager for every 20 recipes on your Network, which stores one copy of each Packaged Recipe Holder. The other copies are stored in individual Unpackagers.%n%nIf your Packager is too slow, parallelize the recipes it does with Packager Extensions!
dj2.quest.db.437.title=Package

dj2.quest.db.440.desc=Make a Plasma Core in the Laser Focus and use it to craft your first Draconic Core!%n%nAll of the 4 included ingots are non-trivial, but all of them can be fully automated. You'll need a lot of Draconic Cores moving forward, so make sure to automate every single step of its creation!
dj2.quest.db.441.title=On Channels
dj2.quest.db.441.desc=Applied Energistics is a very powerful mod, but there are some things you'll need to wrap your head around before being able to fully take advantage of all the mod's features.%n%nFirstly, channels. Each AE2 machine that's capable of transferring data (items, fluids, gases, or other magical resources coming in later Chapters) uses 1 channel. A simple Glass Cable, Covered Cable, or Smart Cable is capable of transferring 8 channels. Smart Cables also show how many channels they're currently transferring. Dense Cables on the other hand are capable of transferring 32 channels, but some AE2 parts cannot directly connect to Dense Cables (e.g. Import and Export Buses or Storage Buses).%n%nAdditionally, channels also transfer power to each AE2 machine, so you don't have to do that separately. If you only want to transfer power, you can use a piece of Quartz Fiber.%n%nBut channels don't come for free! When setting up a simple ME System without a Controller, you'll have access to a total of 8 channels, which isn't a lot - so to be able to autocraft and autoprocess, you'll need to set up an ME Controller multiblock.%n%nThe ME Controller multiblock is the heart of your ME System, so you can only have 1 of it. To build the multiblock, simply place ME Controller blocks next to each other, such that they only touch with their faces. One of the most common ME Controller layouts is therefore the edges of a cube.%n%nWhy does an ME Controller help? Well, each side of every Controller block provides you with 32 channels! That's a lot of channels if you add it all up! But it might not be the easiest thing to try to transmit those channels to far away places...%n%nSo you have 2 options here: P2P tunnels and/or the ME Quantum Ring.%n%nP2P Tunnels basically compress 32 channels into 1. Simply connect a Dense Cable to one side of your Controller, place a P2P Tunnel on it, and route some Smart Cable out from it. This piece of Smart Cable can store 8 P2P channels, which, when uncompressed, could be used as 8x32 §r=§r 256 channels on the other side. To uncompress the channels, simply use another P2P Tunnel on the other side, and connect the two with a Memory Card! However that's not all. The P2P line you just created is technically not part of your network - it's a separate network! You'll need to power it through either a Quartz Fiber from your original network or another Energy Acceptor. Also, since this is a separate network, feel free to use another Controller multiblock in it, if 8 P2P channels aren't enough.%n%nSo, with P2P Tunnels, if you ever need to route up to 8 Dense Cables to a certain place - you no longer have to! A Single Smart Cable will be enough.%n%nAlternatively, you can transmit up to 32 regular or P2P channels wirelessly through a Quantum Ring multiblock. To set this up, use 1 Quantum Link Chamber with 8 Quantum Rings around it. Set this up twice in 2 far-away places, and connect them up with 2 Quantum Entangles Singularities that are bound to each other. (You can create a bound pair by blowing up an AE2 Singularity and an Ender Pearl Dust.) Be aware that both Quantum Ring multiblocks have to be powered through an Energy Acceptor or Quartz Fiber, but the two sides are still part of the same ME Network, so you can't use two Controller multiblocks on each side.%n%nHowever sometimes creating 2 separate systems is very handy.  Because you can create small systems without a Controller multiblock, this allows for small, localized areas to serve as isolated networks, known as a "subnetwork". The subnetwork is exposed to the main network via an ME Interface, and from the subnetwork it is being attached with an ME Storage Bus to the main network. This is typically used for autocrafting. Remember that each subnetwork will need power in order to function, which can be supplied through any of the normal ways, in addition to a Quartz Fiber linking power (and only power) from the main network.%n%nFor example Annihilation Planes don't need to be formatted if they're part of a subnet. This is very useful for Botania Livingrock automation for example. Or if you'd like to create a system that drops any items it gets, you can make a small AE2 Subnet with some kind of storage and a formatted Annihilation Plane - this can be very useful for automating items that need to be crafted by dropping something into a liquid.%n%nIf you have any more questions, try things in a Creative world, or ask others on the official Divine Journey 2 Discord server: https://discord.gg/rH9pyS7

You don't have to completely finish one to begin working on the next, but you could if you wanted to. %nIn this pack we have made the major points, which unlock real progression through the next Chapter, larger and distinct.%n%nQuests have a requirement to complete, located on the right side. On the top left, they have a description of what the quest is (or a pun). On the bottom left, they will typically have a reward, which can be claimed by clicking the "Claim" button at the bottom. Some quests are "Choice Quests", meaning you must choose between one of several rewards before claiming. Some quests have multiple rewards.%n%nQuests have different forms as you unlock them and progress through them:%nWhen you cannot access a quest and thus cannot complete it, it has a gray background.%n- Unlocked quests are indicated by a glowing red background.%n- Completed, but with quest rewards still unclaimed quests are indicated by a glowing green background.%n- When you have completed a quest and claimed its reward (if any), it turns into a static green background.%n%nThere is a button on the bottom right of the Home page which toggles the notification appearing on the top of the screen when completing a quest.%n%nAdditionally, there are 3 buttons on the left side of the screen.%nFrom top to bottom, they are:%n- Claim all quests on the page (note that Quests with choice rewards will not be claimed).%n- Adjust the viewing size so all quests are displayed.%n- Back, which returns to the home page.%n%nYou can return to the prior page of the questbook by pressing the Page Back key (default: §eBackspace§r).%n%nLastly, you can see some additional data for quests by enabling "Advanced Tooltips" by pressing F3+H.
dj2.quest.db.472.title=What is JEI?
dj2.quest.db.472.desc=§cJEI§r, or §cJust Enough Items§r, is the most downloaded mod ever. It is used to search items and recipes that mods add. As such, it's crucial to understand how §cJEI§r works. This pack also features §cJEI Utilities§r, which adds extra functionality to bookmarks and a recipe history panel.%n%nLeft Clicking on an item or pressing your recipe key (default: §6R§r) displays all the recipes to craft that item - it won't show anything if there are no recipes to make it.%n%nRight Clicking on an item or pressing your use key (default: §6U§r) displays all the recipes that use that item - again, if there are none it won't do anything.%n%nYou can use the scroll wheel to change pages when viewing recipes. You can also use the §6Backspace§r key to go back to the previously viewed recipe.%n%nOn the left side of the recipe viewer, you see all* the places that recipe can be done in.%n    *due to compatibility issues, it's only most, not literally all.%n%nIf you click on the title of the page, you can "Show All Recipes," which lists every recipe in the game! %n%nPressing your Bookmark key (default: §6A§r) saves the item to the left side of your inventory - use this to keep track of what you intended to do 3 seconds ago.%n%n%n§cJEI Utilities§r Features:%nOn the bottom right of the search panel a history of the most recently viewed items appear.%n%nWhen looking at a specific recipe, pressing the Bookmark key will save that specific recipe as a bookmark. Pressing §6CTRL§r while pressing your Bookmark key will prevent bookmarking the ingredient unless it is the output item. When viewing the recipe of a bookmark marked this way, the specific recipe saved will be viewed first.%n%nWhile holding the Display Recipe Preview key (default: §6CTRL§r), the recipe will be displayed in-line with the other content. %n%nWhen pressing the Transfer Recipe(Single) key (default: §6CTRL + W§r) or Transfer Recipe(MAX) key (default: §6CTRL + T§r) while hovering over an item with a bookmarked recipe and inside of the relevant inventory will transfer the required items, highlighting any missing items if it fails.%n%nWhen pressing the Pick up bookmark key (default: §6Middle Click§r) you can adjust the position of bookmarks.%n%n%n%nHow to search with §cJEI§r:%n%n§cJEI§r uses substring matching, meaning searching "coal" finds both "Coal" and "Charcoal".%n%nYou can search from a mod by using @ - eg. "@botania" finds everything from the mod Botania.%n%nYou can search for two separate things by separating them with §cJEI§r's "or" symbol |, a vertical line, typically located above the Enter key.%n%nYou can exclude results by attaching a - before it, eg. "-@minecraft" finds everything that isn't from Vanilla Minecraft.%n%nYou can also combine these, for example while "@alchem" would show both Alchemistry and Blood Magic: Alchemical Wizardry items, you can use "@alchem -@blood" to show only Alchemistry, or you can use for example "@alchem -@blood|singu" to search for everything in Alchemistry AND Singularities.%n%nIf you can't find an item in a Chest or a Crafting field, §cJEI§r allows you to double click the search bar to toggle highlighting, which will highlight any item in an inventory that matches your search.%n%nIf you'd like to import a recipe into a Crafting Table without having to lay it out, you can simply view the recipe in §cJEI§r while in the Crafting interface, and Left Click the "+" button. That will move all items into the Crafting field. If you'd like to move as many items into the Crafting field from your inventory as possible, hold Shift while pressing the "+" button.

One of these benefits is allowing you to see the exact requirements to unlock the quest - meaning you aren't scrambling around trying to figure out what you missed midway through a later chapter.%nWhile not a shortcut, you can enable NBT data visibility by opening your inventory, clicking on the gray cog in the top left called "Client Settings", selecting FTB Library, and setting "Display Item NBT" to true.%n%n§eF3+G§r, or Show Chunk Borders, allows you to see the, well, borders of the chunk you are in. However, a superior option exists, by default bound to §eF9§r. This allows you to switch between 4 modes:%n- Invisible,%n- Corners,%n- Full (similar to F3+G)%n- Region.%n%nUse this to make sure you never build a complex automation process across a chunk border that then unloads, as that can clog things up, or even cause crashes.%n%n§eF7§r, or Show Spawnable Spaces, highlights all currently spawnable spaces as Red, and all spaces that are spawnable during the night.%n%n§eButton 4§r (which can be changed in the keybinds menu if your mouse doesn't have more than 3 buttons), or Place in World puts the item you are currently holding into the world, somewhat akin to placing it in an item frame.%n%n§eF3+P§r, or Pause on Lost Focus only does something in Singleplayer. This is active by default, and when it is active, switching tabs while not in an inventory will open the escape menu, pausing the game. %n%n§eF3+A§r, or Reload Chunks, will reload any loaded chunks, which can fix issues such as chunks not rendering, or blocks being invisible.%n%nThere are a wide variety of other shortcuts useful as you progress through the pack, if you check Escape -> Options -> Controls, you can see and change almost all of them.
dj2.quest.db.475.title=What is Divine Journey 2?
dj2.quest.db.475.desc=Divine Journey 2, often shortened as "DJ2" is an expert pack oriented around DivineRPG and automating Magic Mods.%nDJ1, typically known as Divine Journey, was a pack with similar goals made for 1.7.10 in 2017. You do not have to play DJ1 to understand DJ2.%n%nDJ2 is an Expert Pack. This means different things to different people, but here we are using it to mean:%n%n1. The pack will take a long time to complete.%n%n2. The pack is structured around progression - most things are gated, many recipes are changed from their default.%n%n3. The recipes will be expensive, and will require automation - sometimes minimal, sometimes extreme. Fortunately, there are a lot of tools that help you in this endeavor, and they'll slowly get unlocked through the first half of the pack. Applied Energistics is going to be your friend, you'll need to autocraft or autoprocess almost everything that there is a quest for.%n%n%nThe goal of the modpack is to "Find the Meaning of Life", already located inside a convenient bag in your inventory upon startup, so it shouldn't be that hard to.... Oh. Oh hold on a second. It needs some sort of a Key to open... The "Key to Infinity?" Oh. Oh no. That's gonna be hard.%n%nSimilarly to Divine Journey, you'll need "Infinite Infinity Ingots", while not truly "infinite" this time, you'll need a LOT to craft the Key to Infinity, and it'll be best done using a Creative Chest.%n%nSoooo the goal of the pack is basically to get to Creative items... Not so original, I know.%n%n%nBut what IS original is the progression. Over 600 unique custom items and over 5000 changed recipes will guide you towards the end... Good luck!%n%n%nThe structure of the modpack is the following:%n%n1. Early game: Vanilla Minecraft, Tinkers' Construct, Totemic, Roots, Immersive Engineering, Early game Mekanism, AE2 Item Storage.%n%n2. Big Exploration Block: Better Nether, Twilight Forest (optional), Atum 2, Erebus, Aether I, Iceika.%n%n3. Big Tech Block:%n   - Stage 1: Extra Utilities Pt.1, Open Blocks, Mob Grinding Utils%n   - Stage 2: Thermal Expansion, EnderIO Pt.1, AE2 Crafting Terminal & Fluid Storage%n   - Stage 3: Industrial Foregoing, some RFTools, SolarFlux Reborn, QuantumFlux%n   - Stage 4: Actually Additions, EnderIO Pt. 2, Simply Jetpacks%n   - Stage 5: Mekanism Pt. 2, Extra Utilities Pt. 2, AE2 Autocrafting & Autoprocessing, Wireless AE2, Ender Utilities, Ender Storage.%n%n4. Big Magic Block:%n   - Stage 1: AbyssalCraft Pt. 1, DivineRPG start, Blood Magic Pt. 1, EvilCraft Pt. 1%n   - Stage 2: AbyssalCraft Pt. 2, Botania Pt. 1%n   - Stage 3: Botania Pt. 2, Blood Magic Pt. 2, EvilCraft Pt. 2%n   - Stage 4: Thaumcraft%n   - Stage 5: Bewitchment%n   - Stage 6: Thaumic Augmentation, Thaumic Energistics%n   - Stage 7: DivineRPG end, LightningCraft, Extreme Reactors%n   - Stage 8: Astral Sorcery, AgriCraft, lategame Extra Utilities, Galacticraft%n%n5. Lategame: Draconic Evolution, Alchemistry, RFTools Dimensions, Avaritia, Creative Items, Unlocking the Meaning of Life.
dj2.quest.db.476.title=Beam Core? Huh, more like Be-gone Core!
dj2.quest.db.476.desc=Break down some Beam Cores into Nickel Chloride and Polyvinyl Chloride!
dj2.quest.db.477.title=Gone, Reduced to Elements
dj2.quest.db.477.desc=
dj2.quest.db.478.title=I thought it was over... But alas, more Cores!
dj2.quest.db.478.desc=Obtain some Kaolinite from Draconic or Wyvern Cores, and combine it with Barium, Psyllium, and Chaotic Cores to get the actual final tier of Draconic Evolution Cores: The Corrupted Core!
dj2.quest.db.479.title=The Abyss is trippy
dj2.quest.db.479.desc=Break down Refined Coralium into Psyllium, or use some Hybrid Abyssalium to also get Potassium Permanganate.
dj2.quest.db.480.title=Bury 'em!
dj2.quest.db.480.desc=Get some Han Purple from Wyvern Cores and some Barium Sulfate from Crystaltine Ingots, and break them down further into elemental Barium.%n%n...%n%n- Why are Helium, Curium, and Barium called the medical elements?%n%n- Because if you can't Helium or Curium, you Barium!
dj2.quest.db.481.title=Chemical Caster
dj2.quest.db.481.desc=It is highly recommended that you do the "Growing Chaos" quest at the top of this Chapter before doing this quest, so you won't have to kill another Chaos Guardian... unless... you'd LIKE to do that. Then go ahead.%n%nBuild the Chemical Caster multiblock!%n%nThe quest requires an additional Resistive Heater, which you'll use to provide heat for the machine. You can use any Mekanism Heat Acceptor on the top. Simply power the Resistive Heater, and set its power usage high first (to a couple thousand RF/tick), to have it heat up. Once it's sufficiently hot, you can bring its power usage down to only about 200 RF/tick. It takes a little while to have the heat transferred to the multiblock, so be patient.%n%nUsing this machine, you can cast any solid Alchemistry element into its Ingot form. It's fast, and it's available earlier than the Chemical Combiner, which is also capable of doing this. However the Combiner can create a bunch of Compounds as well.%n%nYou'll likely end up using both of the machines later on.
dj2.quest.db.482.title=Rubbing it in
dj2.quest.db.482.desc=Break down Tungsten into Rubidium in the Fission multiblock!
dj2.quest.db.483.title=Why didn't you tell Alphonse Elric about this?!
dj2.quest.db.483.desc=Build the Fission multiblock!%n%nYou can check your Alchemistry Guidebook to see how to construct it, but it's a simple 5x5x5 hollow cube of Fission Casing blocks, with a 3-tall pillar of Fission Cores in the center. Then make sure to place the Fission Controller while looking AT the multiblock. (Sometimes the Guidebook shows its orientation incorrectly.)%n%nThen power the Controller, and you can input and output items from any side.
dj2.quest.db.484.title=Holy Molybdenum!
dj2.quest.db.484.desc=Break down Bismuth into Molybdenum in the Fission multiblock!
dj2.quest.db.485.title=10^100 Chrome
dj2.quest.db.485.desc=Use Potassium Dichromate, Chromium Oxide, Wafers, or Rainbow Tablets to get some Chromium!
dj2.quest.db.486.title=The opposite of Pokemony
dj2.quest.db.486.desc=Get some Antimony Trioxide from End Steel, and break it down further into pure Antimony!
dj2.quest.db.487.title=Good luck pronouncing this!
dj2.quest.db.487.desc=Combine some Zirconium, Yttrium, and some Beryllium Alumide into Zircyttrid Beryllium Alumide!
dj2.quest.db.488.title=Breakout on Acid
dj2.quest.db.488.desc=Break down Beryl Zincite to get Beryllium Alumide and Silicon Trioxide!%n%n%n...Oh, the wonders of Alchemy!
dj2.quest.db.489.title=Yeet-rium
dj2.quest.db.489.desc=Break down some Platinum, Iridium, or Gold in the Fission Multiblock to obtain some Yttrium!
dj2.quest.db.490.title=Old nightmares
dj2.quest.db.490.desc=Break down some Gold or Mercury in the Fission multiblock to obtain some Zirconium!
dj2.quest.db.491.title=Atomizer
dj2.quest.db.491.desc=Make an Atomizer to turn any Fluid into atoms and molecules! It's the easiest way to get H20 or any other molecule that has a liquid form at room temperature.
dj2.quest.db.492.title=Anti-Strong Compound... Weak Compound?
dj2.quest.db.492.desc=No, it's pretty strong. Make some!
dj2.quest.db.493.title=Heat resistant AND allows for circuits
dj2.quest.db.493.desc=Zirconium%nYttrium%nScandium%nCopper%n- %nBeryllium%nAlumide%nArgon%nCarbonate%nHelium%n%nSheet.%n%nOr, a Zysc-Baach Sheet, for short.%n%nCraft it in the Liquicrafter!%n%nRemember that Helium and Argon are considered liquids right now, so use liquid transporting Tanks or Fluid Conduits.
dj2.quest.db.494.title=It's a Scandal!
dj2.quest.db.494.desc=Break down Niobium further into Scandium!
dj2.quest.db.495.title=Chipmunk Voice
dj2.quest.db.495.desc=Break down some Lithium or Beryllium in the Fission multiblock into Helium!
dj2.quest.db.496.title=Where have all the flowers gon
dj2.quest.db.496.desc=Break down Rubidium further into Argon!
dj2.quest.db.497.title=Am I D.?
dj2.quest.db.497.desc=Break down Luminessence to get Urea, then break it down further into Amide!
dj2.quest.db.498.title=Millions and millions of Seeds
dj2.quest.db.498.desc=Combine a Corrosive Will Crystal, Blutonium Dust, and some Concentrated Cloud Seed in the Vat to obtain some Growth Infusion Liquid! Then use your Growth Infusion Liquid to obtain some Crop Sticks!%n%nThese sticks are way more powerful than they look like - they allow you to duplicate any Mystical Agriculture Seed planted on them, either through spreading or using the Clipper.%n%nYou can also mutate the same type of crop with itself by planting 2 of them on a Crop Stick placed diagonally from each other, and placing a double-Crop Stick in the corner. The Seeds will eventually mutate (which you can speed up a lot with the Imaginary Time Block), creating a potentially better one.%n%n§c§lWARNING:§r You cannot use the EnderIO Farming Station with these Crop Sticks. Instead, try any of the following to harvest the crops:%n%n- Botania Drum of the Wild or Horn of the Wild inside a Player Simulator;%n- An Actually Additions Farmer;%n- Or an Industrial Foregoing Plant Interactor.%n%nIn all cases, you'll also need a way to gather the resources. I recommend a Ranged Collector or an Absorption Hopper.%n%nEach AgriCraft Seed has 3 stats, and maxing them out is commonly referred to as "10/10/10'ing the Seed". The first stat increases the rate at which the crop grows; the second stat increases the average yield of the crop; the third stat normally reduces the damage weeds can do, but since weeds are disabled in this pack, it only increases the chance of getting clippings from clippers.%n%nYou can check the 10/10/10'ing progress in a Seed Analyzer.%n%nYou'll need a bunch of Seeds in one of the later Chapters, so definitely take advantage of AgriCraft!
dj2.quest.db.499.title=Wield 'n Build
dj2.quest.db.499.desc=Craft an Unbreakable Wand! This is the perfect tool to encase your infrastructure that you have built up so far, or even build a house (or a castle?) to live in. The Wand also works with blocks in a /dank/null which has some useful applications when building. It has a really large build range, but make sure not to misclick with it... Or you might need to do more cleanup work than if you HADN'T used the wand at all...(You can use /wandOops to fix your error)
dj2.quest.db.500.title=Salty
dj2.quest.db.500.desc=Craft an Evaporator. When a fluid is placed in it, it will slowly evaporate into an item. You'll want to passively automate this, as you'll need a large amount of Mineral Salt.%n%nYou can push fluids from any side and pull items from any side as well.
dj2.quest.db.501.title=Gone, Reduced to Elements
dj2.quest.db.501.desc=Craft a Chemical Dissolver! Give it some power and toss in a material and it will dissolve down into elements. You can push inputs and pull outputs from any side.%n%nIf you'd like to craft more Dissolvers but you don't have enough Chaos Shards, try to move towards the quest near the top of this Chapter called "Growing Chaos" that allows you to craft Tiny Chaos Fragments!%n%nThis quest also unlocks a lot of other quests on this page that aren't connected to it. This is because the connections would get really messy otherwise!%n%n§6(Note that if you have for some reason enabled edit mode, you must disable it to continue.)
dj2.quest.db.502.title=Machine Frame ^who knows
dj2.quest.db.502.desc=Okay I might have lied when I said the Draconic Machine Frame was the highest tier... but I swear this time there is no more... no more Machine Frame tiers... nah-ah, not at all. Nada. Yup. Definitely.%n%nTo craft the required Crystal Cores, you'll need Rock Crystals with size at least 300 and purity at least 75%%.%n%nTo grow Rock Crystals, place a Bucket of Starlight in a 1x1 hole. Throw a Rock Crystal inside and wait. This will slowly increase its size. Don't keep diving into the hole to see how much your Crystal has grown, the size changes will happen in larger jumps, and if you keep picking up the Rock Crystal, the size changes will never happen. Once the Rock Crystal size increases a bit, the Bucket of Starlight gets used up.%n%nIf the size of your Rock Crystal is nearing maximum (400), when throwing it into a pool will have a chance to split it into two. One will have the same purity, and the other will have its purity increased by 0-9%%.%n%nThis means for every split, on average you gain a Rock Crystal with a 4.5%% increased purity. Depending on what the original Crystal's purity was, it might take you 10 or even 20 full Crystal splittings before you can reach a high purity value. So it's important to start with at least a decent Crystal.%n%nOnce you obtain a couple high-purity Crystals, it's time to automate this! Your best friend will be Integrated Dynamics.%n%nThere is a great explanation by Direwolf20 in his video titled "Enigmatica 2 Ep88 Dynamics Crystal Growth Pt2", (search for it on YouTube and watch it carefully if you're unsure how to do this automation). Link is: https://youtu.be/8F3K8sSN3aM%n%nTo put together the ingredients, you'll once again need to use the Laser Focus multiblock. It is recommended that you swap out the Huge Energy Input Hatch into a Ludicrous one.
dj2.quest.db.503.title=Calcium Carbs
dj2.quest.db.503.desc=Dissolve Meteoric Iron to gain some Calcium Carbonate. Your immediate use for them is to craft Mekanism Heat Input blocks from Modular Diversity.%n%nHowever you might need more Chaos Shards for the upcoming multiblock, so check out the quest near the top of this Chapter called "Growing Chaos" to get more!
dj2.quest.db.504.title=So THAT's what Mana tastes like
dj2.quest.db.504.desc=Break down AbyssalCraft Crystallized Mana or Runes of Mana into Ammonium. Your best bet is to use the highest tier AbyssalCraft Crystallized Mana Clusters.
dj2.quest.db.505.title=Never before seen reactions
dj2.quest.db.505.desc=Obtain some Beryl from Mirion Ingots and Zinc Oxide from Alchemical Brass, and combine them into Beryl Zincite!
dj2.quest.db.506.title=Feelin' like a real Alchemist
dj2.quest.db.506.desc=Craft a Chemical Combiner! This machine allows you to create a bunch of Compounds as well as any Alchemistry Ingot. You can also create some basic materials with it.%n%nSimilarly to the Dissolver, you can input and output from any side.%n%nYou can combine up to 9 inputs, and each input slot can have any number of items. Sometimes putting elements into different slots will yield different results, for example both a Copper Ingot and a piece of Copper Dust takes 16 Copper elements, and placing the input into slot 1 or 2 will determine what the output is going to be.%n%nThis machine is 4x slower than the Chemical Caster multiblock, however it's still an essential block.%n%nIf you want to automate it without using AE2 patterns such as doing a process passively, you want to set a target recipe by looking at a Combiner recipe in JEI, and pressing the "+" button to import it into the machine. This way, all the input ingredients will land in the correct slot but can only support one recipe.%n%nTo create AE2 Patterns for the machine, just set the ae2 interface on blocking mode and use Alchemistry Slot Fillers if there are empty spaces between ingredients in the recipe. These Slot Fillers are incredibly cheap, but get consumed upon crafting, so you'll want a lot of them if you need them for any recipe.
dj2.quest.db.507.title=From the Abyss, into Alchemy
dj2.quest.db.507.desc=Break down AbyssalCraft Methane into Alchemistry Methane!
dj2.quest.db.508.title=Strontium
dj2.quest.db.508.desc=Use one of the main Impetus items to get Strontium Carbonate and break it down further into regular Strontium!%n%nYou might want to semi-automate the creation of some of these Impetus items. You can use an External Crafter to keep your Primordial Pearl repaired.%n%nHowever, once you get to Fission, you'll be able to break down regular old Osmium into Strontium, so it's not hugely important to automate it now.
dj2.quest.db.509.title=Nice and fertilized
dj2.quest.db.509.desc=Combine some materials in your Chemical Combiner into some Alchemistry Fertilizer, then into some Mystical Fertilizer!%n%nYou can use the latter to Bone Meal your Mystical Agriculture crops.
dj2.quest.db.510.title=Diamonds!? Nah, just Di - ammonium...
dj2.quest.db.510.desc=Combine some Ammonium, Hydrogen, and Phosphate in your Chemical Combiner into Diammonium Phosphate!
dj2.quest.db.511.title=Electrolyzer
dj2.quest.db.511.desc=The Electrolyzer is an optional machine, but it is one of the ways to get Chlorine using only Water and Salt as the inputs. The other way is to just dissolve Mekanism Salt in a Chemical Dissolver.
dj2.quest.db.512.title=Chromatic Barry
dj2.quest.db.512.desc=Make some Chromium Barium Compound!
dj2.quest.db.513.title=Tight -anium
dj2.quest.db.513.desc=While regular Titanium does yield Titanium elements, you can only get Titanium Oxide from Compressed Titanium or Titanium Boxes. The Boxes reliably yield more, not just with a 50%% chance.
dj2.quest.db.514.title=I'm Elemental
dj2.quest.db.514.desc=Break down some Evil Infused Iron into Lead Iodide, and break it down further into regular Iodine!
dj2.quest.db.515.title=Melted Stars
dj2.quest.db.515.desc=Melt some Nether Stars to get Hydroxylapatite, and break it down further into Phosphate.%n%nThis might be the perfect time to upgrade your Wither farm as well!
dj2.quest.db.516.title=So that's why your Tung Stanks when you bite this
dj2.quest.db.516.desc=Dissolve some Stone Ichor into Tungsten!
dj2.quest.db.517.title=Growing Chaos
dj2.quest.db.517.desc=1. First use Iodine, Mercury, and Copper Chloride in your Liquicrafter multiblock to get a little bit of Impure Mercury-Iodine Mixture.%n%n2. Then purify this liquid with some Nickel Chloride to get pure Liquid Iodine.%n%n3. Finally, combine 10mB of Liquid Iodine with some Mesquite and Titanium Oxide to get 12 Tiny Chaos Fragments!%n%nIt might not be a bad idea to automate this entire process. I recommend using 3 separate Liquicrafters for it.
dj2.quest.db.518.title=We can't GO to Mercury, but we can GET some Mercury
dj2.quest.db.518.desc=Break down Supremium Ingots into Mercury Sulfide, and break it down further into elemental Mercury.

dj2.quest.db.519.desc=Alloy up some Cadmium and Arsenic! What could POSSIBLY go wrong?!
dj2.quest.db.520.title=Chad-mium
dj2.quest.db.520.desc=Break down some Flying Ointment into Cadmium Sulfide, and break it down further into Cadmium elements.
dj2.quest.db.521.title=Taste the rainbow... Or don't, actually, DON'T!!!
dj2.quest.db.521.desc=Break down Rainbow Plates into Arsenic Sulfide and further into pure Arsenic.%n%nSo yeah, DON'T taste the Rainbow. For your own safety.
dj2.quest.db.522.title="Sap Hire" - is what a gemologist would call "Free Honey".
dj2.quest.db.522.desc=Combine some Cobalt Aluminate, Potassium Permanganate, and Aluminum Oxide to get your first Sapphire Gem!
dj2.quest.db.523.title=CoAl, not Coal...!

dj2.quest.db.525.desc=Break down Silver into some Vanadium!
dj2.quest.db.526.title=Barium Circuitry
dj2.quest.db.526.desc=1. Melt your elemental Tungsten in your Liquifier.%n%n2. Then also melt some Nitrogen. Even though Nitrogen is a gas, this time it can only be picked up in Fluid tanks! Low on Nitrogen? Well, there are several ways to get it. Check out all the possibilities in JEI!%n%n3. Then combine the above two liquids with a Copper Canister, some Barium Calcite, some Silicon Trioxide, some Dense Ice from the Asteroid Belt and some Sapphire to obtain an Oxygen-Rich Barium Calcite Perpetuator!
dj2.quest.db.527.title=Repeated Breakdown
dj2.quest.db.527.desc=Break down Han Calcite into Barium Calcite and Copper Carbonate!%n%nTake a minute to appreciate Alchemy... This is what Han Purple and Calcium Carbonate became...!
dj2.quest.db.528.title=Melting Atoms
dj2.quest.db.528.desc=Craft a Liquifier! Input 16 of certain elements to obtain their liquid form. You can use any side as item input and any side as fluid output.
dj2.quest.db.529.title=Boring
dj2.quest.db.529.desc=Break down Fluorine, Neon, or Sodium into Boron!%n%nSodium comes from regular old Salt, so that's probably your best choice.
dj2.quest.db.530.title=Queue-queue the Hellfire
dj2.quest.db.530.desc=Break down Bottled Hellfire into Cucurbitacin!
dj2.quest.db.531.title=Rubying it in

dj2.quest.db.538.title=Mmm...(th)at's quite nice
dj2.quest.db.538.desc=Break down Void Metal or any base Impetus item to obtain Mesquite! Remember that Void Metal Seeds are now available to craft.
dj2.quest.db.539.title=Copper Bismid Sheet
dj2.quest.db.539.desc=Combine some Copper Carbonate and Bismuth into a Sheetmetal shape!
dj2.quest.db.540.title=Bismuth
dj2.quest.db.540.desc=Obtain some Bismuth from Demonic Elixirs!
dj2.quest.db.541.title=Magnesium Compounds
dj2.quest.db.541.desc=Break down Basic Wafers, some Flying Ointment, or some Bottled Frostfire to obtain Magnesium Sulfate.%n%nAlso break down any of the Will Crystals to get Magnesium Oxide. The best yield comes from Destructive, Vengeful, and Steadfast Will Crystals.
dj2.quest.db.542.title=What Lead to this?!
dj2.quest.db.542.desc=Break down some Lead in the Fission multiblock into Niobium!
dj2.quest.db.543.title=Weak Fusion Plant
dj2.quest.db.543.desc=Gather up the materials listed on the right and build a Weak Fusion Plant! This machine is capable of combining certain elements by adding their atomic numbers. It's not as strong as Alchemistry's Fusion multiblock though, but we gotta work with what we got.%n%nThis machine requires a lot of power to use though, so definitely use the appropriate power transfer methods. Stellar Conduits won't cut it for some recipes, so consider making some Cryo-Stabilized Fluxducts!
dj2.quest.db.544.title=Fission makes these easier!
dj2.quest.db.544.desc=Using Fission, now you can simply get Strontium from Osmium, Chromium from Silver, and Manganese from Tin!
dj2.quest.db.545.title=An Inscriber's dream
dj2.quest.db.545.desc=Build the Mass Inscriber multiblock!%n%nThis is an incredibly fast version of the AE2 Inscriber, allowing you to create Circuits and Processors in bulk without even needing any Presses!%n%nTake advantage of this machine!
dj2.quest.db.546.title=Neon
dj2.quest.db.546.desc=Break down Calcium or Scandium into Neon!%n%nYou can use Condensed Milk or Eggs for Calcium, and you can get Scandium from Niobium, and Niobium from Lead.
dj2.quest.db.547.title=Heating up and Cooling down
dj2.quest.db.547.desc=Fission requires some sturdy coolants! Cadmium Arsenic provides appropriate casing and Neon can cool the machine. Unfortunately these break after each infusion though.
dj2.quest.db.548.title=Handle it with care...!
dj2.quest.db.548.desc=Fuse up some Uranium from Niobium and Antimony. As long as the tube is sealed, it shouldn't cause any harm...
dj2.quest.db.549.title=A Paladin living in a Palace made of...
dj2.quest.db.549.desc=Break down Uranium into Palladium!
dj2.quest.db.550.title=A tube separates us from certain death
dj2.quest.db.550.desc=Fuse up some Palladium and Cadmium into Plutonium!
dj2.quest.db.551.title=Guess its radioactive level from its name

dj2.quest.db.614.title=Patternless
dj2.quest.db.614.desc=There are a lot of quest titles and quest descriptions, and these seeds really haven't been giving me much to work with, you know? Cut me some slack, I'm trying my best. Like, what could you come up with for Wither Skeleton Seeds, Titanium Seeds, and End Steel Seeds? I know I could have arranged them differently, perhaps shuffled these and Sortless around, but that would ruin the theme of Sortless requiring just the base tier 4 seed, with Patternless requiring an additional (or two!) seed to be crafted. Really, the name of this quest is a lie, because I made sure there's a pattern for everything. It's important to notice the patterns - they tell you a lot about how something works. Or doesn't, depending. As is the case here - there is a pattern, but it's not something you can construct a name based on. It's not a pattern substantial enough to create with. Some patterns just aren't there enough to impact the world. But maybe you can never be certain of the pattern of a thing. Your perception of an instance may change with time, and while the patterns within it will not, is perception not reality? Does your perception of a pattern create the pattern? Is a pattern but a social construct we create to comfort ourselves in the chaotic cosmos that encompasses all we might ever know? So perhaps a better name for this quest would be "Patternless?" However, that attracts less attention than a statement delivered with certainty, such as "Patternless." And if one believed that attention creates what is given attention, would it not be in the interests of a creator to attract as much attention as possible? In each mind that gives it attention, their work is replicated.%nSo is birthed clickbait, the art form of creating predominantly visual stimuli that increases the value of a product in the prospective buyer's mind beyond what they would have otherwise believed it to be. Clickbait is often said to be a misrepresentation of the contents of the product, but this is a misunderstanding of the term. For example, this quest name was misleading, but was not clickbait, as it was not designed and likely did not increase your internal evaluation of the quest within. Clickbait can be misleading, but it is far more commonly used to highlight the best qualities of the product within. This understanding of clickbait includes advertising, although advertising frequently induces the belief in value, and is not limited to simply increasing it.%nAnother aspect of this concept is memes - that of actions or information spreading and mutating via imitation of others. It is most commonly used to refer to jokes shared on the internet, but ideas spreading and mutating via imitation is as old as humanity. Gossip and fireside tales are examples of memes prior to the internet. The folk tales told varied based on the teller, but the most successful elements were consistently included in them. The characters have different names or faces, the setting may change, the exact actions vary, but the themes remain.%nThe creation of a meme and creation of clickbait are, while unique in purpose, similar in action and goal: to get people to spend their attention on it, using references and hooks to increase engagement. Some people do this for fun, as a hobby, as a creative outlet. Others do it for profit, to convince you that entry is worth the price. Everything you know influences your choices. And now you know this. Will this knowledge change what you do? Would you even know if it had? In this essay, I will...

dj2.quest.db.621.desc=Craft some EnderUtilities Portal Frames and 2 Portal Control Panels! These are the best Teleportation Devices you could get your hand on so far, as they do not require any power, and can send you to either another EnderUtilities Portal (with the Link Crystal (Portal)), or using any of the other 2 Link Crystals, you get also go to a some other Location or Block you specify (but you won't be able to return in that case).%n%nThey're very handy, and can be built vertically or horizontally, in any shape and size (within limits), as long as the Portal Frame blocks from a closed loop!

dj2.quest.db.622.desc=Assemble the Mob Loot Fabricator. This multiblock serves as a replacement for laggy spawners and mob farms.

The black is hard to see on the black, so I'll explain the Sooty Marble configuration here:%n%n- The 8 corners of the 5x5x5 machine are all Chiseled Sooty Marble Blocks.%n- The edges of the cube on the floor and on the ceiling are Sooty Marble Arches.%n- The edges of the cube on the sides are all Sooty Marble Pillars.%n%nThis quest requires 1 Normal Fluid Output Hatch, because, while not strictly needed to build the multiblock (its place, directly behind the Demonic Will Output Hatch, can be an item output or just a Sooty Marble Arch), it is needed for multiple recipes you will want to use.%n%nThis quest also requires 2 Normal Item Outputs, because, while not strictly needed to build the multiblock, it is the minimum size required for most recipes.%n%nIn order to process the largest recipes, you need 42 output slots, which means placing 7 Normal Item Outputs in their allocated places - the Fluid Hatch and the rest of the bottom floor of the multiblock. Alternatively, you could wait until you can craft larger Item Outputs, but wheres the fun in that?%n%nMake sure to pull from all the Output Hatches (including the Fluid Output Hatch) of the machine so it doesn't get clogged up!

This will default to where you're standing, but can be changed. Click 'Commit' to add the new location. You can then click 'Rename' to change its name to something other than coordinates.%n%nYou can do this as many times as you want, in multiple different locations. From this point on, use Shift+Right Click to open the Advanced Dislocator, as Right Click will teleport you to the selected location.%n%nThis all works even cross-dimensionally. No more pesky Portals! We're OP now.
dj2.quest.db.643.title=Mind over matter
dj2.quest.db.643.desc=Craft a Bound Dislocator (Player). This is used as a crafting ingredient for the Advanced Dislocator, but it also has its own usage:%n%nRight Clicking this Dislocator will bind it to yourself. Another player or entity can then use that dislocator to teleport to your location as long as you are online.
dj2.quest.db.644.title=Infuse with Infused

dj2.quest.db.754.title=Devil's Advocate
dj2.quest.db.754.desc=Used to "reshape reality" by remaking the pillars of creation in our image.
dj2.quest.db.755.title=Tear down the Pillars of Creation
dj2.quest.db.755.desc=Your quest is to destroy the pillars of creation with a Red Morningstar. This is what Greek Gods have built up over the millennia, and it really is the greatest goal of all. §4U§rp on the pantheon you can still see them stand. Its other ability and the way§r it's capable of such destruction is to stop the sun's rays during the day (called an "enid" in ancient Greece). You can have up to three of these at the same time (hence "daylight") or you can shoot an object and throw it towards the sun. The red sun rises from the earth when it comes across the Moon before it blows up into the stars (a sign of a great Sun), so to speak. If you're a scientist, it's probably a no-brainer to use a red moon to see its effect immediately. You can get some good information about this in a few different papers of mine. But what if all the red suns of creation are created from a yellow sky? That's what I will talk about next, so let's get started first: A red moon creates a lot of energy, but most of it is simply light energy. For example, you will see the sun rise from the earth before it breaks up into stars to get our attention here. It seems to me that if you are in the early evening sun, that is what you will see. However, when it was just the usual nighttime sunrise, it would appear with only the red or white moon shining on it. Now, all we have to do is to imagine everything is going to be bright no matter what we were doing. Let's see how simple it is. Let's create an object with 0 light-years and 0 red/white lights. Then, imagine we were doing something involving no material. At a certain point of time, that object will start spinning up and around. Since ever§4y§rthing is done in a specific time frame, where is the source of energy in the object? The answer here will certainly come from a certain type of physical description of physics, but a "physical description" will make it easy to see. In general, the red sun and the blue moon are more active than the white moon and are closer to the sun. Both seem to be more active. Let's assume an object where some hot air and a cold atmosphere are present. When you look for a planet in the region of Enceladus, you look for a body with a very small surface. If you find a small planet in orbit of the sun, this will cause your planet to orbit around the large surface so it will probably be a very big body with very hot, dense dust. However, if the planet lies in any lower mass than the surface, a faint reddish glow will appear. This reddish glow is a reflection of the planet and an echo of the red sun. Notice that if you look at the surface of a red sun, it is really an echo of the red sun. You can find in Enceladus a body with a very small surface, and this planet will be as big and bright in the bright sunlight as it is in the red sun. Assuming this p§4l§ranet can be interpreted as the "red moon", we already have a hint on what it means to "call for the help of the red moon" to cause ultimate destruction. Secondly, let's focus on the exact execution of the destruction of the pillars of creation. In his book, "The Creation of Heaven", Albert Einstein says that the entire earth appears to be a fire that burns slowly to death. However, his book explicitly shows that this fire is not, in fact, the "burning of entire heavens". Although the concept of fire has been proposed at least once before, the existence of the flame is the only explanation for the mysterious fire. §4A§rs Einstein says, the idea of having a flame burning on top of a pillar does not seem to apply to the entire world (just how close it should be to an actual burning pillar would be difficult to explain). After all, all the sun, moon, planets, and even sunspots in the solar system have their "burning cores" on either side of the pillars or the pillars are the only visible forms of the burning flame as they are just visible. While Einstein clearly acknowledges this, the explanation he gives is a complete lie. In fact, he says that light shines at an angle of one-half of a degree to one-to-two thirds of a degree, and that such light is simply an idea invented to justify the existence of the golden flames at the very top of the pillars. The light of a single-colored flame could not have created the idea. And then Einstein began to say that the whole idea of the Great Fire Theory and the golden flame at the level of the pillars as an idea, no matter his technical difficulty, may well be an idea invented by two different philosophers, namely the German §4S§rchiller and von Humboldt. While all these ideas are merely speculation and conjecture, each of them is true in its own way. And what has come into those two ideas is simply their own reflections on one another. What these two ideas say about the structure of the universe gives more significance than any other possibility that may be explained in the next section. But what if there is more to be said? There is. For, the very first impression that you give to your child as an object of interest is that it is a "great fire fire", a great flame that has a very bright and strong flame, and "not in a good way". The Essence of Breaking. We could have all discovered by accident, even as a little child, and that's exactly what Einstein did. Through sheer luck or knowledge, we may never know, but this is the way he managed to gather the energy required to destroy reality itself and break the pillars of creation. "But we still live in this reality, right?", you may ask. Wrong! Einstein recreated this dimension by splitting and copying one that's only about 4-5 quadrillion strings, or approximately 10^-18 cm away in one of the unreachable directions of the four-spatial dimensional scope we're living in. Turns out the pillars contained enough energy to create infinitely many realities, only one of which was necessary to hold up. This whole occurrence is described fully in the Book of Chaos, a not-so-well-received scientific paper about the truth of this world. Unfortunately scientists in our age are too preoccupied to see the real truth. But now you know too.
dj2.quest.db.756.title=Remade in our Image
dj2.quest.db.756.desc=The Book of Chaos is correct, but doesn't explain what happened in its entirety. The truth is, one book was lost during the transfer of realities. It is now dubbed 'The Ancient Book of Chaos', and it only lives in our memories. It contained information on how to rebuild our reality, or even... shape it in a way that's... advantageous for some. It is interesting to observe the ways that the apparent 'real world', as it has been called over the §4z§rillenias gets in the way of what could be called a 'real world'. The concept could be very simple. It's what happened in the past and what happened in the future: all that is left is a constant pressure and need for change. I believe these are now well known principles of reality to some extent. Now I may have missed some of the interesting details that you may have missed. For instance, while I believe that The Ancient Book of Chaos wasn't lost, and that it remains buried somewhere in Germany... Einstein wouldn't be called Einstein if he didn't think about the consequences of messing with the fabric of reality itself. He must have saved the real truth somewhere! I believe the reason the world has changed so drastically during and after Einstein's death is because of this reality reshaping. Einstein boosted the capabilities of our reality by at least §42§r00%%, and made scientific and technological progress multiple factors faster. Just look around! Don't you see how much the world has accelerated since? It's not hard to see. Though it could be explained by considering other factors, some truths and some assumptions of our reality. But the whole picture is much larger! What if these factors are the same? What if it is the same for all dimensions and time, and that dimension is Earth? It is very possible, and possible, that the physical dimension of our reality is different from that of Earth, and that Earth does not change to a greater or lesser degree. That's a point that every person agrees with. Earth does not change to an extent to a greater or lesser degree because it is an extremely small world! Just look how much space there is with Earth. We are so small we make other things tiny! Why, what happens if they are just smaller §4c§rompared to Earth? Earth and Earth change simultaneously, and as their size increases, so does their size and its strength. That is, Earth is denser, thinner, and stronger with every passing day. Imagine a more stable Earth, and we could live very long, simply because the Earth has never changed in its size. But a less stable Earth, which is a smaller, weaker, and more brittle planet, would experience a smaller amount of change from its bigger size. As a result, we would become less stable, more dense, less strong, and with each passing day more unstable. A more stable Earth would therefore have a greater chance of changing because of more changes in density and strength, and less chance to be stable if we moved one inch or less from its smaller size. In other words, a more stable Earth would have a much bigger edge on its larger world than it's larger as a whole, thus giving it an edge it's very, very hard to break. To this end, a more stable Earth would also have greater latitude, more space, more energy, and much more surface area. A more stable (but smaller, more temperate) Earth, in which there could be a greater chance of life outside the Solar System than there is on Earth, would create more problems than its more stable Earth. If we think about the effects of changing temperatures for the last 300 million years, how many of those that have existed on, say, Earth during that time were large landforms, what's the difference between 1.3 times the landmass that we have today instead of a few years later and 50 times the amount? §4I§rt depends upon whether they're all large, even if you assume the rate is very similar." The scientists, with the support of the U.S. Geological Survey, also found that global temperatures during that time were "significantly warmer" than at any other time during the past 100 million years, including the past 60 years. "The changes we saw in the past few thousand years are consistent with climate variability, if something comes up, a global warming of 100 degrees C or more is occurring," said study coauthor Stephen Knapton. "It's not a coincidence, this is consistent with a number of other studies in other parts of the world that have found that climate change impacts are happening almost everywhere in North America." This is just an example of not looking at the whole picture. If all scientists worked together, maybe they'd be able to figure it all out! But humanity still has a language barrier, a quarter of us still don't have sufficient food or drinking water, racial issues still stand, so we can't easily move forward. I'm afraid I won't get to see the light of day before the true truth gets discovered... I'm leaving this message here so you §4c§ran share it with others. That is, if you trust me. I have provided a lot of evidence, and you can go out to Germany and hunt for 'The Ancient Book of Chaos' yourself. I believe it should be hidden in north-western Ulm, but that's just a hunch, I have no evidence of that. Anyway, this metaphoxyl is making me dizzy, I think I need some sleep... I hope I have convinced you though. When has old Blitterscrow ever lied to you?! There is no way I could be wrong. There is no way. I'm not wrong. I couldn't be wrong. I- I- ...

dj2.quest.db.817.desc=Divine Journey 2 is a heavily tweaked and edited pack. While we have done our best to ensure there are no bugs, there are some things we simply cannot change.%nFor the known bugs, we warn you wherever relevant. However, there are some bugs we may not yet know. In that case, please report bugs to GitHub: https://github.com/Divine-Journey-2/Divine-Journey-2/issues%n(This link is also available from the right side of the pause menu.)%n%nHowever, before doing so, take a few steps that are likely to fix any bugs:%n- make sure you have the latest version of the pack%n- make sure your download did not get corrupted%n- make sure you have the most recent version of Java%n- make sure your launcher is NOT CurseForge. As of 31/07/21, they force use of a long outdated version of Java, regardless of settings%n- make sure that your pack is not significantly modified, either through config changes or the introduction of new mods%n- make sure that, if you are playing on a server, they have not changed various settings or recipes (typically structure generation and chunkloading)%n%nOnce all of those are done, please make an issue describing your bug on the github, filling out any and all requested information.

Once formed, click on the central Cauldron to create the multiblock!%n%nProvide power to one of the 3 black squares on the back. Inputs are on the top. When facing the front of the machine, the left slot inputs the main items, and the right slot inputs the additional items. Output is on the front bottom, where the Cauldron used to be during construction; pull items out of there. The Arc Furnace can be used to smelt, alloy, or create Steel, so additional outputs (a.k.a Slag) can and should be removed, and are automatically pushed out on the back, below the power input.%n%n§cWARNING: Do NOT build this on a chunk border. Press F9 twice to show them. If built on a chunk border, eventually the machine could get corrupted and crash your world.

No longer will you have to search for specific spots to put your items into, you can simply Right Click your Drawer Controller with an item, and if you have room for it in your attached Drawers, it will get placed inside one.%n%nYou can also attach any kind of item translocator, like Hoppers, Pipes, Transfer Nodes, etc. to the Drawer Controller to send items into your Drawer Storage. Later I recommend you to attach an AE2 Storage Bus to your Drawer Controller. That way, your ME System can see your entire Drawer Network, and have access to items inside.
dj2.quest.db.905.title=But... how MUCH power?
dj2.quest.db.905.desc=Craft a Current Transformer! Break up your wiring into 2 pieces by connecting it to a generator (like a Kinetic Dynamo) on one side, and a Machine or Capacitor on the other side.

Once built, click on one of the central Fence blocks on a longer side with your Engineer's Hammer to form the multiblock.%n%nThe Crusher doesn't have an interface. Instead, when provided with power (through the orange dot on the center back) and throwing materials inside, it will try to crush it into dust form granted there exists a crushed form of the given item. It will gladly eat up items that don't, so be careful what you throw in it. To output items, simply place a Chest next to the black dot on the side.%n%n§cWARNING: Do NOT build this on a chunk border.

dj2.quest.db.915.desc=Punch some tall grass to obtain some Industrial Hemp Seeds! Then, plant them to get some Industrial Hemp Fiber! I recommend using Roots Elemental Soils.
dj2.quest.db.916.title=Beta Redstone Furnace
dj2.quest.db.916.desc=Craft an External Heater! Place some Furnaces next to it, and provide it with power through the orange dot! Now adjacent Furnaces will use the IF power you're generating instead of fuel to smelt.%n%nIf you have access to Cincinnasite from the Nether, you can also craft a Cincinnasite Forge for double Furnace speed!
dj2.quest.db.917.title=A simple sample
dj2.quest.db.917.desc=Craft one or more Core Sample Drills. When provided with power and Right Clicked, it will dig up a sample from the ground. The sample may contain some Veins. If it does, the given chunk is suitable for mining with the Excavator. The machine won't actually mine up the terrain, just generate some of that Ore as output. The likelihood of finding a Vein has been increased, hopefully you'll have no trouble finding them close enough to your Power generation.%n%nNote: You can place Core Samples as a special block via Shift+Right Click!
dj2.quest.db.918.title=It's a chest for... power!
dj2.quest.db.918.desc=Craft an LV Capacitor! This block can store 100,000 IF (or RF). Each side can be configured to accept power, or output power. Click on a side once to turn it into a side that accepts power (blue dots), or twice to turn it into a side that outputs power (orange dots).

To use the Revolver, Shift+Right Click on it to fill it up with ammo. Then, simply Right Click to shoot. Now, you don't wanna run out of ammo during a fight, do you? That's what the Speedloader is for! Once you've run out of ammo, it'll quickly fill up the Revolver with its contents, so you can pew-pew like your heart desires (and while you have ammo). To apply the chosen upgrade, use the Engineer's Workbench. Note: The other upgrades are also craftable.
dj2.quest.db.920.title=Take THAT, it's CHEMISTRY!
dj2.quest.db.920.desc=Craft a Chemical Thrower! The chosen upgrade can be applied in the Engineer's Workbench. To actually use the Chemical Thrower, fill it up with any fluid. You can use an EnderIO Tank for this, or simply Right Click on any kind of Tank. The Chemical Thrower will then spray out the fluid on Right Click. Well what's the point of this - you'd ask. Well, try Shift+Right Clicking to turn it into FLAMETHROWER MODE (granted the Fluid you filled it with is flammable). It's an extremely wasteful weapon, but can absolutely destroy some enemies.
dj2.quest.db.921.title=Into Mekanism!

It's also recommended to use a ranged weapon if you want to fight it head to head.%n%n2. You can set up some kind of a hidey hole where you can get into, but Baykok can't. Baykok can't activate buttons, trapdoors, or break blocks.%n%nOnce you have defeated Baykok, he will drop his Bow. You can use this bow with regular arrows, or use it for upcoming crafting recipes. Both of these actions will require 1 durability per shot or craft.
dj2.quest.db.924.title=No more mining!
dj2.quest.db.924.desc=Craft the required components for an Excavator and a Bucket Wheel! Check the Engineer's Manual -> Heavy Machinery -> Excavator to see how to set both of them up. Before you do so though, make sure to set it up in the right area. Craft a Core Sample Drill (see the quest beside this one). Once you found a suitable location, power it from the side (one of 3 black dots), and place an output chest (or preferably Itemducts connected to 2-3 Drawers) as an output. Be aware that this machine uses 1024 RF/tick, so you need good power generation to keep it going.%n%n§cWARNING: Do NOT build this on a chunk border. Press F9 twice to show them. If built on a chunk border, eventually the machine could get corrupted and crash your world.
dj2.quest.db.925.title=BwooooOOOOOH... BANG!

dj2.quest.db.944.title=Skipping Twilight...?
dj2.quest.db.944.desc=During the creation of the pack, a vote was held on the Divine Journey 2 Discord server about the inclusion of Twilight Forest into the main progression line. The result was: Implement an item that lets you skip the Twilight Forest, since many of us players have already completed it, and there is nothing new to see.%n%nIf you wish to skip the Twilight Forest, craft a Twilight Key. This will allow you to craft the Lamp of Cinders, which would otherwise be the final item obtained in the Forest, and allow you to progress further into the pack.%n%nHowever, if you haven't played through Twilight Forest yet, I highly encourage you to try it out, since it's most likely the single best exploration mod in Minecraft - especially if OP flight methods aren't available. The best way to travel through Twilight in this pack is with the Roots Sky Soarer spell, as well as Tinkers' Slime Boots and Slimesling.%n%nDue to Twilight's popularity though, it's incredibly overused: it's included in a large portion of packs, which is understandably why people get bored of it.%n%nSo if you wish to follow this route, you don't have to enter the Twilight Forest to go on.
dj2.quest.db.945.title=Enter the Twilight

dj2.quest.db.978.desc=Make some Enriched Alloy in your Metallurgic Infuser!
dj2.quest.db.979.title=Heavy Metal
dj2.quest.db.979.desc=Craft a Metallurgic Infuser! This is the main machine you'll use to create all the various Mekanism components. Like for all Mekanism machines, you can simply connect an Immersive Engineering Wire Coil to it by placing a Wire Connector on any side. Once it's powered, place the main material in the second slot from the left, and the infusing material in the first slot from the left. Note that the machine can only hold and use one type of infusing material at once, meaning you're most likely better off creating multiple Metallurgic Infusers for maximum efficiency. To automate the machine, click on the Side Config button on the left. You can select which side you want items, infusion materials, and energy to be input on, and which side you want to use as output. Make sure to push and pull items in/out with a Hopper or an Itemduct with an active Servo on it. And one more thing: All Mekanism machines can be picked up and moved by a Crescent Hammer from Thermal Expansion, so you don't need to worry about energy loss.
dj2.quest.db.980.title=Toughen up
dj2.quest.db.980.desc=Craft a Steel Casing! It's used as a basis of all Mekanism machines.
dj2.quest.db.981.title=At your Service
dj2.quest.db.981.desc=Craft some Servos! Attach them onto an Itemduct to have it automatically pull items out of a container. Right Click on the Servo to turn Redstone Control to Ignored mode and have them always run! You can also craft Hardened Servos at this stage, which pull slightly faster.
dj2.quest.db.982.title=Better than Hoppers
dj2.quest.db.982.desc=Craft some Itemducts from Thermal Expansion! To use them, place one next to a container or machine, and apply a Servo if you want to pull items out of it. Servos can be Right Clicked on to change them to Always On mode.
dj2.quest.db.983.title=It's watching you
dj2.quest.db.983.desc=Craft the Eye of Gaea...!%n%n%n%n...Just don't let it SEE you..... D:
dj2.quest.db.984.title=Allowy me to introduce...
dj2.quest.db.984.desc=...the Atomic Alloy! Such impeccable purity! Such magnificent beauty! It's the highest tier Alloy from Mekanism.
dj2.quest.db.985.title=Crushin' it even more
dj2.quest.db.985.desc=Craft a Mekanism Crusher! It works alongside the Enrichment Chamber, but instead of grinding Ores, it can grind down Ingots into their Dust form.
dj2.quest.db.986.title=Ore Doubling, but faster
dj2.quest.db.986.desc=Craft an Enrichment Chamber! You can power it and automate it just like the Metallurgic Infuser. This machine doubles ores, just like the Tinkers' Smeltery. However it's much simpler to automate, as it only takes up 1 block of space. Once you ground up your Ores, simply transfer them into an Energized Smelter to turn them into Ingots! And voilà, ore doubling!
dj2.quest.db.987.title=Like a Capacitor
dj2.quest.db.987.desc=Craft a Basic Energy Cube! This is the Mekanism way to store energy for later use. You can configure its sides to select where the energy should be inputted or outputted. You can also charge items by placing it into the slot marked with a Plus, and remove charge from an item by placing it into the slot marked with a Minus (granted there is space in the Energy Cube). You can move this machine and all other Mekanism machines with a Crescent Hammer (Shift+Right Click). But by breaking it, it will still retain its energy.
dj2.quest.db.988.title=Drive me crazy
dj2.quest.db.988.desc=Craft an ME Drive! This is where you can store all your Storage Cells with items inside.
dj2.quest.db.989.title=Print-proont, bzaa-bzee!
dj2.quest.db.989.desc=Combine your previously created Printed Circuits in the Inscriber to create some Processors! It's recommended to craft and automate multiple Inscribers, as you'll need many Processors from now on.
dj2.quest.db.990.title=Shiny purple gems
dj2.quest.db.990.desc=Throw some Charged Certus Quartz Crystals, Redstone, and regular Quartz into a puddle of water and watch as they all transform into Fluix Crystals!
dj2.quest.db.991.title=Oh no!
dj2.quest.db.991.desc=It needs power... a lot of power... to awaken...
dj2.quest.db.992.title=Useful green square thingy
dj2.quest.db.992.desc=Craft 4 Basic Control Circuits! These are heavily used in the creation of more machines.
dj2.quest.db.993.title=Too pricey?
dj2.quest.db.993.desc=If your machines consume a lot of energy, it might be worth upgrading them with Energy Upgrades! Each machine can accept 8 of them. Use the top right icon on the UI of any machine to apply them!
dj2.quest.db.994.title=Swear it's not Uranium
dj2.quest.db.994.desc=Use your Osmium Compressor to create some Infused Obsidian and Infused Glowstone Ingots! Then combine them in the Arc Furnace or the Smeltery to create some Osgloglas Ingots!
dj2.quest.db.995.title=The Heart of your ME System
dj2.quest.db.995.desc=Craft an ME Controller and power it through the Energy Acceptor! Each side can provide 32 channels that your AE2 machines can use. If you're running low on channels, try extending the Controller! It can only take the shape of a rectangular frame, so no four Controllers can touch each other in a 2x2 shape!
dj2.quest.db.996.title=Additional Presses
dj2.quest.db.996.desc=Find the additional five custom Presses inside of Sky Stone Chests in the middle of Meteorites! It's not too important to find all of them right now, since you'll only need them once you revisit AE2 with Autocrafting, Autoprocessing, Fluid/Gas Storage, higher tier Storage Cells, Wireless Terminals, and Spatial Storage. These are what custom Presses and Processors are used for.
dj2.quest.db.997.title=A Desert where Dinos died
dj2.quest.db.997.desc=Craft a Meteorite Compass and use it in Atum! That's right, AE2 Meteorites don't generate in the overworld, they only generate inside Atum! This compass will point you to the nearest chunk with a Sky Stone Chest, which generates in the middle of a Meteor. It will start spinning as soon as you've entered such a chunk. It can be a bit tricky to find the Meteor, but it always exists. Each Sky Stone Chest will hold a random selection of the Presses you'll need.
dj2.quest.db.998.title=Connect up your Drawers!
dj2.quest.db.998.desc=Craft a Storage Bus and connect it to your Drawer Controller to have access to all those items in your ME Network! You can also connect it to various Chests and other storage devices for the same functionality. Also make sure to Right Click on it and set its priority higher than your ME Drive's, because otherwise all your items will get sent back to your Drive, not your Drawers.
dj2.quest.db.999.title=Need items elsewhere!
dj2.quest.db.999.desc=Craft an Export Bus! Use it to send items to different locations from your ME System!%n%nDue to how Applied Energistics 2 identifies items, if an item with a significant amount of NBT data is placed in the system (such as a Backpack or Tinkers' Construct tool), the item may not be able to be taken out via the terminal. There are a few solutions to this, but the easiest is to use a Fuzzy Card on an Export Bus, bookmark the item that you want to remove, and then drag the bookmark into the Export Bus. This will extract the item from the ME system.
dj2.quest.db.1000.title=Collect all the items!
dj2.quest.db.1000.desc=Craft an Import Bus! Use it to send items from an outside source into your ME System!
dj2.quest.db.1001.title=Print-print, bzz-bzoo!
dj2.quest.db.1001.desc=Use your Inscriber to create some Logic, Engineering, and Silicon Presses!
dj2.quest.db.1002.title=The OG four
dj2.quest.db.1002.desc=Find the original four Applied Energistics Presses located inside Sky Stone Chests in the middle of Meteorites! These are the Presses you'll need first.
dj2.quest.db.1003.title=Precision Press
dj2.quest.db.1003.desc=Craft an Inscriber! Use AE2 Presses found in Atum and basic materials to create Printed Circuits and Processors! To automate it, push items into the machine from different sides. The top side will accept items that go in the top slot, the side will accept the central items, and guess what the bottom does. And pull out items from the other side. The Inscriber takes regular power, but can also work using the power from an Energy Acceptor through Glass Cables.
dj2.quest.db.1004.title=Channel the channels
dj2.quest.db.1004.desc=A Dense Cable only has a 32-channel capacity, but if you want to route more channels to a faraway location, you can use a P2P tunnel. With this, you can transform your Smart or Dense Cable to route 32 channels per cable-channel, then on the other end use another P2P tunnel to turn it back into regular functionality. To connect the two P2P tunnels at each end, use a Memory Card.%n%nThis will save you many Dense Cables. Instead of having to run 16 Dense Cables at once, you can run just 1, and have 16-16 P2P Tunnels at each end, with pairs joined by Memory Cards.
dj2.quest.db.1005.title=Giga Storage
dj2.quest.db.1005.desc=Wanna go further? Craft a 1024k Storage Component!
dj2.quest.db.1006.title=Mega Storage
dj2.quest.db.1006.desc=Once you have access to higher tier materials from other Chapters, come back to craft a 256k Storage Component!
dj2.quest.db.1007.title=Zwoooooosh!
dj2.quest.db.1007.desc=Craft some Acceleration Cards! This can speed up your Import/Export Buses, or the crafting speed of your Inscribers.
dj2.quest.db.1008.title=Purity is key
dj2.quest.db.1008.desc=Craft a Crystal Growth Accelerator and place it next to a block of Water! Provide energy to it through Glass Cables and throw Certus Quartz Seeds inside. Watch as they turn into Pure Certus Quartz Crystals! Note that this machine requires a lot of power. It's recommended that you break up your line of Glass Cables with a Toggle Bus, place a Lever next to it, and only turn it on when you need the Crystal Growth Accelerators to be active.%nYou can technically place up to 6 of these around the water for even faster growth, although placing the 6th will prevent you from accessing the water.
dj2.quest.db.1009.title=Faster! Faster!!
dj2.quest.db.1009.desc=If your Basic Universal Cables can't transfer enough energy, craft some Advanced ones! However, use these ones sparingly as well, since they cause FPS lag too due to inefficient rendering.
dj2.quest.db.1010.title=More Core Galore!
dj2.quest.db.1010.desc=Craft two Formation and Annihilation Cores! They are used as Crafting Components for AE2.
dj2.quest.db.1011.title=Where my items at?!
dj2.quest.db.1011.desc=Craft an ME Terminal and connect it to your Network through a Glass or Smart Cable! You can view your items stored in the Network, search for specific items and sort them in numerous ways.
dj2.quest.db.1012.title=S-T-O-R-A-G-E-!-!-! >:OOO
dj2.quest.db.1012.desc=Craft a 64k Storage Cell. This is the final Storage Cell available before getting into Thermal Expansion.
dj2.quest.db.1013.title=Ultimate Energy Storage
dj2.quest.db.1013.desc=Craft an Ultimate Energy Cube! For now, this will be your best way of storing energy! ...But wait until you get into EnderIO, late Mekanism, or Draconic.
dj2.quest.db.1014.title=Plumber Pack++
dj2.quest.db.1014.desc=Not being able to route your Liquids fast enough? Craft some Advanced Mechanical Pipes, maybe they'll do the job!
dj2.quest.db.1015.title=Wannabe Plumber
dj2.quest.db.1015.desc=Craft some Basic Mechanical Pipes to be able to move Fluids around easily!
dj2.quest.db.1016.title=Bringing power to the people
dj2.quest.db.1016.desc=Craft all 3 tiers of Powercell! By using two or more Powercell Cards - one for the input, the rest to link to that in the link slot, and then be moved to other Powercell inputs - you can form a cross-dimensional multiblock of power storage and transfer!%n
dj2.quest.db.1017.title=Storage!
dj2.quest.db.1017.desc=Craft a 1k ME Storage Component. You can either choose to craft a Storage Cell out of it or further upgrade it into a 4k Storage Component.
dj2.quest.db.1018.title=Hypernet! It works!
dj2.quest.db.1018.desc=Craft some Glass Cables! They can transfer AE2 power and up to 8 channels.
dj2.quest.db.1019.title=Advancing
dj2.quest.db.1019.desc=Craft 4 Energetic Alloy in the Arc Furnace or by melting Gold, Redstone, and Glowstone in the Smeltery! Then using these materials, craft an Advanced Control Circuit!
dj2.quest.db.1020.title=It's a me, Mario!
dj2.quest.db.1020.desc=Craft some Elite Mechanical Pipes, if you're still not satisfied with the speed of your liquid transfer! For now, this is the highest tier available.
dj2.quest.db.1021.title=Channel overflow
dj2.quest.db.1021.desc=Craft some Dense Smart Cables! They can transmit 32 channels, but can't connect to microblocks, such as a Storage Bus, Exporter, or Importer. Use (non-dense!) Smart Cables branching off from a line of Dense Cables to avoid this problem - but remember, these Smart Cables can only carry 8 channels!
dj2.quest.db.1022.title=Channel entanglement
dj2.quest.db.1022.desc=Craft some Smart Cables! Adding to the functionality of Glass Cables, they also show how many channels run through the given Cable, and how many are left available. Different colors of Smart Cables don't connect to each other, they only connect to colorless Smart Cables.
dj2.quest.db.1023.title=Ultra Storage
dj2.quest.db.1023.desc=This is getting ridiculous... Craft a 4096k Storage Component!
dj2.quest.db.1024.title=Extreme Storage
dj2.quest.db.1024.desc=You've made it! This is the highest tier Item Storage Component available...! Craft a 16384k Storage Component, also known as a 16M Storage Component!
dj2.quest.db.1025.title=Calculating, calculating?
dj2.quest.db.1025.desc=Use your Inscriber with Pure Certus Quartz Crystals to create some Calculation Processors!
dj2.quest.db.1026.title=It's Pure!
dj2.quest.db.1026.desc=Craft some Certus Quartz Seed and grow them into Pure Certus Quartz in the Crystal Growth Accelerator!
dj2.quest.db.1027.title=From small to large cells
dj2.quest.db.1027.desc=If you have a bunch of smaller Storage Cells full of items, but you want to upgrade to larger Cells, it's worth crafting an ME IO Port. Using this you can empty your items from a smaller Cell into your Storage Network. If the Network only consists of larger Cells, this will effectively transfer items from smaller to larger Cells.
dj2.quest.db.1028.title=STORAGE!!! >:O
dj2.quest.db.1028.desc=Craft a 16k Storage Component! You might wanna consider storing your items in this or slightly larger Cells if you're starting to run some Quarries.
dj2.quest.db.1029.title=Storage! :O
dj2.quest.db.1029.desc=Craft a 4k ME Storage Component! These might be enough for the early game. They have plenty of space to store your items.
dj2.quest.db.1030.title=Mek-wires ac-quired!
dj2.quest.db.1030.desc=Craft some Basic Universal Cables! They can be used to easily transfer energy between two spots! However, I still encourage you to use Immersive Engineering Wires, since in 1.12 Mekanism Universal Cables tend to cause FPS lag due to inefficient rendering. So use them sparingly!
dj2.quest.db.1031.title=Pump it (louder)!
dj2.quest.db.1031.desc=Turn up the radio! Blast the stereo! Riiiiiiiight noooowwww...! And craft an Electric Pump! Use this if you need a large amount of Lava from the Nether. It's easier than using individual Buckets for each Lava source block. Simply set it up above a source block of a fluid, power it from the side and place some kind of a fluid container on top. Later you'll be able to use it in conjunction with the Quantum Entagloporter to transfer your Fluids wirelessly.
dj2.quest.db.1032.title=Press Pressentor
dj2.quest.db.1032.desc=Craft an Osmium Compressor! This machine can create more crafting materials for Mekanism. You can automate it the same way as the Metallurgic Infuser.
dj2.quest.db.1033.title=1x1 Fluid Storage
dj2.quest.db.1033.desc=Work your way up to an Ultimate Fluid Tank! Right now this is your best way of storing Fluids in a 1x1 area, although for more storage you can make the Dynamic Tank multiblock. Like all Mekanism machines and blocks, this can also be picked up and moved with a Crescent Hammer (Shift+Right Click), and it'll still retain its stored fluid. This is also true when upgrading to a higher tier Tank.
dj2.quest.db.1034.title=Huh, get buuuurned!
dj2.quest.db.1034.desc=Craft an Energized Smelter! You can smelt your Dusts into Ingots or simply use it as a Furnace powered by energy.
dj2.quest.db.1035.title=Too loud?
dj2.quest.db.1035.desc=Craft 4 Muffling Upgrades! You can apply these via the top right button of the UI of any machine, and with each upgrade it'll make the machine considerably quieter.
dj2.quest.db.1036.title=Too slow?
dj2.quest.db.1036.desc=Craft 8 Speed Upgrades! This is the maximum that a Mekanism Machine can accept. Simply click on the Upgrades slot in the top right of the UI of any machine, and place the upgrades in the top right slot. But watch out, with each upgrade, the machine will require more and more power!
dj2.quest.db.1037.title=I'll take one RAA!
dj2.quest.db.1037.desc=Climb to the top of the Sunspeaker Tower and destroy the central structure encased in Glass. By Left Clicking on it, it'll blow up and drop a Heart of Ra.
dj2.quest.db.1038.title=Dirty Relics
dj2.quest.db.1038.desc=Find some Relic Ore underground and mine it up without using Silk Touch! Obtain every single type of Dirty Relic from it.
dj2.quest.db.1039.title=Iron Umbergolem
dj2.quest.db.1039.desc=Please read the quest description of the Mud Umbergolem quest! The Iron Umbergolem is found in the North-Eastern corner of the Maze.
dj2.quest.db.1040.title=Onwards, to the Land of Bzz!
dj2.quest.db.1040.desc=Enter the Erebus! Make sure to bring lots of food, good gear, a Backpack, and Water Buckets. You're gonna be inside for a while. Once entered, place your second Staff of Gaea in the Gaean Keystone that spawned on the other side. If the Staff of Gaea does not go into the Gaean Keystone try removing any leaves that are nearby that are not part of the portal frame.
dj2.quest.db.1041.title=For Gaea-lactic travels
dj2.quest.db.1041.desc=Craft TWO Gaean Gems! One's needed to ENTER Erebus, the other's needed to LEAVE Erebus. (You don't wanna get stuck, do you?)
dj2.quest.db.1042.title=Don't offer it too much
dj2.quest.db.1042.desc=Craft an Erebus Offering Altar! To use it, simply Right Click the 3 required items on it, and wait...
dj2.quest.db.1043.title=[ARTIFACTS] Melee Weapons
dj2.quest.db.1043.desc=Find and raid a Pyramid! Go down into the maze below the structure. You can disable traps by Right Clicking on them with a Pickaxe. Get to the end and summon the Pharaoh using 4 Royal Torches. Once defeated, Right Click on its tomb to find various treasures and exactly one Artifact! There are 4 types of Artifacts: Melee, Ranged, Armor & Necklace. You'll need to find two different types of Artifacts (so you'll need to raid at least 2 Pyramids) in order to continue. To complete this quest specifically, you'll need to find one Melee Artifact.
dj2.quest.db.1044.title=The Mystery Revealed
dj2.quest.db.1044.desc=Craft a Scarab! This item is used to enter the Atum. To create the portal, place a 5x5 platform of Sandstone. Then raise up the edges by 1 block, and fill up the resulting 3x3 inner area with Water source blocks. Finally, build a 2-high Sandstone pillar on each of the corners, and throw in the Scarab.%n%nNote: If you're building this portal in Creative Mode for some reason, and it isn't working, try again without flying.
dj2.quest.db.1045.title=No need for Emmer-gency
dj2.quest.db.1045.desc=Grow some Emmer! This is the Atum equivalent of Wheat. In order to grow the seeds, you'll need water and tillable soil, so either find an Oasis or go back to the Overworld for them.
dj2.quest.db.1046.title=Emmer-ge in the Seeds!
dj2.quest.db.1046.desc=Find some Emmer Seeds by either punching tall grass in an Atum Oasis or in a treasure chest!
dj2.quest.db.1047.title=Not M enough, do it EMMER!
dj2.quest.db.1047.desc=Crush your Emmer using your Quern to obtain some Emmer Flour! To turn Emmer Flour into Emmer Dough, simply Right Click with it on a Water source block.
dj2.quest.db.1048.title=Manual labour
dj2.quest.db.1048.desc=Color your Ceramic Tile Blocks brown, then craft a Quern! To use it, place some items on it, then hold Right Click with an empty hand to crush the materials on top.
dj2.quest.db.1049.title=You're a wizard, Harry!
dj2.quest.db.1049.desc=Craft TWO Staves of Gaea. One's used to ENTER Erebus, the other's used to LEAVE Erebus.%n%n[Read this if you've still managed to get stuck in Erebus] Okay. You didn't listen to me. I warned you multiple times. Well, this is your fault now. All the materials required for an Offering Altar, a Gaean Gem and a Staff of Gaea can be found inside Erebus. Emeralds are quite rare, but you might be able to gather them from some of the quest rewards in this chapter. Welp, time to get minin'! Also, if you can't seem to craft a Furnace, just remember how you made Iron the first time. You can find Dandelions and Yellow Petal Blocks in Erebus as well. (By the way, this is why the Offering Altar, the Gaean Gem and the Staff of Gaea only require some basic materials.)
dj2.quest.db.1050.title=Low on food?
dj2.quest.db.1050.desc=Tarantula legs might be disgusting, but if there's nothing better, cook them and munch them up! They're crispy.
dj2.quest.db.1051.title=Insertion assertion
dj2.quest.db.1051.desc=Craft a Gaean Keystone! Then build a portal frame out of any kind of solid blocks and fill the middle with leaf blocks! The frame can be any shape, convex, or concave, horizontal, or vertical. To activate the portal, place the Gaean Keystone in front of the portal, and put a Staff of Gaea inside.
dj2.quest.db.1052.title=Perfect in a mob farm
dj2.quest.db.1052.desc=Craft at least one Velocity Block! Any entity on top will be pushed in the direction the arrow is pointing toward with 5x the base walking speed. Moreover, mobs can spawn on top of these blocks, which make them a perfect candidate for a mob farm floor!
dj2.quest.db.1053.title=Strip the Stripes
dj2.quest.db.1053.desc=Find either some Solifuges (in the Ulterior Outback biome) or some Centipedes (in the Ulterior Outback / Elysian Fields / Subterranean Savannah biome) to obtain some Bio-Velocity!
dj2.quest.db.1054.title=Purity!
dj2.quest.db.1054.desc=Wash some of your Dirty Relics to turn them into beautiful Pure Relics! You can Right Click them on Sunspeakers to sell them for Gold Coins.
dj2.quest.db.1055.title=[ARTIFACTS] Necklaces
dj2.quest.db.1055.desc=Please read the Melee Artifact quest description. This quest is for the rarest type of Artifacts, Necklace Artifacts!
dj2.quest.db.1056.title=Snitches get Riches
dj2.quest.db.1056.desc=Find a Sunspeaker Tower! They're commonly found in mountainous areas of Atum, and emit a red beacon light. Right Click on them with your washed Relics to trade them for Gold Coins! You can get a surprisingly large amount of Coins this way.
dj2.quest.db.1057.title=Thread-threat
dj2.quest.db.1057.desc=Use your Spinning Wheel to create 12 pieces of Linen Cloth! Though that's enough to complete this quest, you might need more thereafter...
dj2.quest.db.1058.title=You spin my flax Right Round
dj2.quest.db.1058.desc=Craft a Spinning Wheel! To use it, hold Right Click on the top with 3 Flax Flowers in your hands. Then You spin my flax right round, right round, when you go down, when you go down, down, since you can take out the resulting flax from down below, from the side of the block.
dj2.quest.db.1059.title=So flax-ible!
dj2.quest.db.1059.desc=Grow some Flax Flowers! You'll need Water and tillable soil, so you might want to find an Oasis or go back to the Overworld for this.
dj2.quest.db.1060.title=Breaking the Fourth Wall
dj2.quest.db.1060.desc=Find a peculiar looking camel-shaped structure in the desert! Go inside to find some developer jokes that might or might not break the fourth wall, and find the Idol of Labor Artifact. You can even start a conversation with it by Right Clicking it...
dj2.quest.db.1061.title=The most useful smoothie
dj2.quest.db.1061.desc=Obtain some Poison Gland from any of the poisonous bugs in Erebus, and a Nettle Leaf from Nettles found in Elysian Fields or the Subterranean Savannahs! This is probably the most useful Potion you'll get access to, since many of the creatures in this dimension poison you. It'll be especially useful when fighting against Tarantulas and the Tarantula Brood Mother.
dj2.quest.db.1062.title=Yummie
dj2.quest.db.1062.desc=Craft an Erebus Co. Smoothie-matic 2000! This machine is used to create smoothies with various magical effects (just like Potions).

dj2.quest.db.1065.title=Desert Fire
dj2.quest.db.1065.desc=Use your Relic Ingots to craft some Relic Blocks and create an Atum Kiln! This is a multiblock structure made of 2 Kiln blocks and 6 Small Limestone Bricks in a 2x2. The Kiln blocks go on top in the same row besides each other. This machine is mainly used to create some Atum-specific items, but can smelt some furnace recipes.
dj2.quest.db.1066.title=Black Tarantula
dj2.quest.db.1066.desc=Find a Giant Eucalyptus Tree that spawns exclusively in the Ulterior Outback biome. Defeat the Tarantulas at the bottom, climb up to the top, and fight the Tarantula Brood Mother! In phase 1, it can only be damaged by ranged projectiles. If you're using a Golden Fury, make sure to stand farther back in order to hit her! Phase 2 begins when the Brood Mother goes below 50%% health. In this phase, you can only damage it by melee hits. It might be a good idea to start off the fight from a platform you've built up next to the tower, so you can't get knocked down in phase 1 at least. Good luck! You'll need it... Once defeated, mine up the Tarantula Egg it leaves behind!%n%nBlack Tarantula, time for the massive come sing ya!%nBlack Tarantula, don't play with my style I might sting ya...!%nBlack tarantula, you want me inject me bacteria..!%nAnd if ya body goin' stiff and your spine goin' numb...

So prepare with multiple Fire Resistance and Healing Potions.%n%nFirstly, you cannot damage this boss with any regularly obtainable weapon or projectile, you can only damage it with projectiles called "Icey Balls" that randomly spawn from the Sun Spirit during the fight. However, both the boss and the iceballs randomly bounce around, which makes it hard to hit the iceballs into the Sun Spirit. Also, you can't wait too long, the iceballs will break a short time after spawning. Meanwhile, Fire Ball projectiles will also spawn and bounce around in the room. Make sure that neither the boss, nor the Fire Balls hit you. But especially watch out for the boss, as it deals a lot of damage on contact.%n%nYou'll need to hit iceballs into the Sun Spirit 10 times to defeat it.

dj2.quest.db.1157.title=The little devil inside
dj2.quest.db.1157.desc=Surround Lava on all 4 sides with Nether Bricks, then throw in some Gold Ingots to create some Demon Ingots. Alloy it with Lunar Reactive Dust to create Demonlord Ingots!%n%n§6Note:§r There is currently a bug with Extra Utilities that makes it so certain modded Droppers cannot create Demon Ingots. Use either the vanilla or the OpenBlocks Dropper when automating it, or switch to EnderIO's Fire Water once that is available.
dj2.quest.db.1158.title=Carved and swirly
dj2.quest.db.1158.desc=Use your Enchanter to make some Magical Wood! You might want to continuously keep creating this for later use.
dj2.quest.db.1159.title=Invading the Arch Lich's castle
dj2.quest.db.1159.desc=Find the Arch Lich's castle in Skythern! Enter it and go through its maze-like rooms to eventually find a Skythern Key in one of its upper domes!%n%nYou'll need to find and break Diorite-variants in most rooms to continue.
dj2.quest.db.1160.title=More colors, the better
dj2.quest.db.1160.desc=Craft some RF Dust! This will only take 1 durability point from your Thermal Conductor Rod.
dj2.quest.db.1161.title=It's hot! It's hot!
dj2.quest.db.1161.desc=Craft a Thermal Conductor Rod! This item lets your craft RF Dust which ultimately lets you get into Thermal Expansion.
dj2.quest.db.1162.title=Crush them insects!
dj2.quest.db.1162.desc=Craft some Mob Masher Bane of Arthropods Upgrades. You can insert at most 10 of these in the machine. This will make the Masher deal more damage against Arthropods like Spiders and Silverfish.
dj2.quest.db.1163.title=Lot of manual work
dj2.quest.db.1163.desc=Craft a Manual Mill! While holding Right Click on it, you generate 15 GP (or Grid Power). This is a resource that doesn't need cables. Simply while you're generating X amount of GP, all your GP using machines will work granted you're using at most X amount of GP overall.
dj2.quest.db.1164.title=Solar Sally
dj2.quest.db.1164.desc=Craft some Solar Panels! Simply placing one down will generate 1 GP in the daytime.
dj2.quest.db.1165.title=Fill it up!
dj2.quest.db.1165.desc=Craft a Stone Drum and upgrade it to an Iron Drum! It can hold 256 Buckets of any liquid, and you can Right Click on it to see how much is left. I would encourage you to set one up to feed Lava into your Smeltery.
dj2.quest.db.1166.title=Better fluid storage
dj2.quest.db.1166.desc=Craft a Reinforced Large Drum! It can hold 4096 Buckets of any liquid! Wow!
dj2.quest.db.1167.title=3rd way to crush
dj2.quest.db.1167.desc=Craft an Extra Utilities Crusher! This is yet another way to turn your Ores and Ingots into Dust! It can be sped up by Extra Utilities Speed Upgrades to make it faster than the Immersive Engineering and Mekanism Crushers.
dj2.quest.db.1168.title=Lunar Larry
dj2.quest.db.1168.desc=Craft some Lunar Panels to be able to generate GP passively during the night!
dj2.quest.db.1169.title=Lava Lewi
dj2.quest.db.1169.desc=Craft a Lava Mill! This machine generates GP when all of its sides are touching lava blocks. Flowing Lava one block away from a source block generates the most GP. Having Lava on multiple sides doesn't increase the generation, but being in the Nether does slightly.%n%nThis generator has been buffed and generates 2x the normal amount. (From base 4 GP to 8 GP - though the max you can achieve is 7 GP in the Nether next to flowing Lava, 1 block away from the source block.)
dj2.quest.db.1170.title=Guillotines hurt
dj2.quest.db.1170.desc=Craft some Mob Masher Beheading Upgrades. You can insert at most 10 of these in the machine. This will make the Masher drop mobs Skulls way more frequently than they would normally drop. Only vanilla Skulls are available though.
dj2.quest.db.1171.title=Water Walter
dj2.quest.db.1171.desc=Craft a Water Mill! This machine generates GP passively when there is flowing water on any of its sides.%n%nThis generator has been nerfed, and generates 1/4x the normal amount.
dj2.quest.db.1172.title=Blows like the Wind
dj2.quest.db.1172.desc=Craft an OpenBlocks Fan! When powered by redstone, it blows any entity away. Useful for a mob farm, although the Mob Fan is even better.
dj2.quest.db.1173.title=Craft of Evil
dj2.quest.db.1173.desc=Drops of Evil are no longer dropped by Wither Skeletons, they're instead crafted. So craft one! And use it to turn surrounding Grass into Cursed Earth! This type of soil makes mobs spawn constantly, so it's perfect for a mob farm. Just watch out, don't let it burn.%n%n§6Note:§r Only the block that the Drop of Evil was used on can be harvested with Silk Touch.
dj2.quest.db.1174.title=Repair ALL the things!
dj2.quest.db.1174.desc=Craft an Auto Anvil! You can automatically insert tools & armor to repair them using liquid experience.
dj2.quest.db.1175.title=Blow higher!
dj2.quest.db.1175.desc=Craft a Mob Fan Height Modifier! You can apply at most 3 of these to your Mob Fan.
dj2.quest.db.1176.title=Mobs aren't a Fan of this
dj2.quest.db.1176.desc=Upgrade your OpenBlocks Fan into a Mob Fan! When powered by redstone, this machine blows mobs with great strength, and it's the perfect way to move mobs off your spawning platform. Additionally, it's highly upgradable, and with max upgrades you'll surely only need at most one per platform.
dj2.quest.db.1177.title=Blow farther!
dj2.quest.db.1177.desc=Craft some Mob Fan Distance Modifiers! You can apply at most 10 of these to your Mob Fan.
dj2.quest.db.1178.title=Sharp like Bisharp's horn
dj2.quest.db.1178.desc=Craft some Mob Masher Sharpness Upgrades. You can insert at most 10 of these in the machine. This will make the Masher generally deal more damage to all things.
dj2.quest.db.1179.title=But I want it HEEEEEEEEEERE!
dj2.quest.db.1179.desc=Craft a Transfer Pipe and one of each type of Transfer Node - Item, Fluid, and Energy. Each functions slightly differently.%nOne big advantage is that you can route items, fluids, and energy all through one pipe - although filtering on the receiving end may be required!%n%n§cThe Item Transfer Node is a highly upgradeable and filterable item routing mechanism, and its much better than Thermal's Itemducts when fully upgraded. It can be upgraded using Extra Utilities' Speed and Stack Upgrades, along with its Filters.%n%n§3The Fluid Transfer Node functions very similarly to the Item Transfer Node (but, you know, with fluids?).%n%n§6The Energy Transfer Node cannot be upgraded, and always transfers 5,000 RF/t.
dj2.quest.db.1180.title=A cylinder! A sphere!
dj2.quest.db.1180.desc=Craft a Building Guide! This block can help you build nice geometric shapes. Use the arrows on top to swap between different shapes. Use the plus and minus signs on the sides to increase or decrease the side of your build. Then power it with a redstone signal to make ghost blocks appear.%n%nYou can also upgrade it into an Enhanced Building Guide to get some more available shapes.
dj2.quest.db.1181.title=Winding Winston
dj2.quest.db.1181.desc=Make a Wind Mill! This machine passively generates GP if there is nothing blocking its northern and southern sides. It generates more in the rain.%n%nThis generator has been buffed and generates 2x the normal amount.
dj2.quest.db.1182.title=Blow wider!
dj2.quest.db.1182.desc=Craft some Mob Fan Width Modifiers! These are likely the most useful upgrades, and you can apply at most 3 of these to your Mob Fan.
dj2.quest.db.1183.title=3rd way to smelt
dj2.quest.db.1183.desc=Yet another Furnace, eh? Well, this one can be pretty speedy with Extra Utilities Speed Upgrades!
dj2.quest.db.1184.title=Ultimate Velocity
dj2.quest.db.1184.desc=Craft at least one Ultimate Speed Upgrade. This makes machines even faster, and it can stack up to 64. You might need that speed for something in the lategame, but be aware that it'll use a lot of GP.
dj2.quest.db.1185.title=How fast can it go!?
dj2.quest.db.1185.desc=Craft at least one Magical Speed Upgrade! This makes machines even faster, and it can stack up to 16 instead of just 4. However, be aware that your machines will use even more GP when upgraded with higher-tier Speed Upgrades.
dj2.quest.db.1186.title=Getting faster
dj2.quest.db.1186.desc=Craft a couple Speed Upgrades, and one Stack & Mining Upgrade.%n%n- Speed Upgrades increase a machine's speed or a Transfer Node's transfer rate.%n- One Stack Upgrade makes it so the Transfer Node sends a stack of items at once, instead of individual ones.%n- The Mining Upgrade is similar to the 1.7 World Interaction Upgrade. It mines Cobblestone when placed inside a Transfer Node which is over a full block with Water and Lava source blocks on the side.
dj2.quest.db.1187.title=Upgrading? Upgrading?
dj2.quest.db.1187.desc=Craft a couple Upgrade Bases! These can be crafted into Speed, Stack, and Mining Upgrades.
dj2.quest.db.1188.title=Glass that can't be Effed
dj2.quest.db.1188.desc=Craft some Ineffable and Dark Ineffable Glass. While players can, mobs can't travel through these blocks, which makes them useful for mob farm or mob spawner walls, as well as general base doors. The regular one does let light through, the dark one doesn't. So mobs will be able to spawn inside when you use the dark variants.
dj2.quest.db.1189.title=Show them the Nether!
dj2.quest.db.1189.desc=Craft some Mob Masher Fire Aspect Upgrades. You can insert at most 10 of these in the machine. This will set all mobs on fire that are touched by the Masher. Perfect for Cooked Porkchops!
dj2.quest.db.1190.title=Die!(monds)
dj2.quest.db.1190.desc=These fellahs deal a lot of damage...! So why not craft some?
dj2.quest.db.1191.title=Fiery Fred
dj2.quest.db.1191.desc=Craft a Fire Mill! This machine generates GP passively while over an active Fire block. Use Netherrack below.%n%nThis generator has been buffed and it generates 4x the normal amount.
dj2.quest.db.1192.title=Don't leave any items floatin'
dj2.quest.db.1192.desc=Craft a couple Absorption Range Upgrades to increase the range of your Absorption Hopper! You can use at most 6 of these.
dj2.quest.db.1193.title=It's your Lucky Day!

dj2.quest.db.1194.title=Cinnabar Ore's finally useful
dj2.quest.db.1194.desc=Use Cinnabar Ore with Liquid Cryotheum in the Fluid Transposer to get a bunch of Cinnabar!
dj2.quest.db.1195.title=Bring the vacuum cleaner
dj2.quest.db.1195.desc=Craft all 4 types of Thermal Expansion Dusts!%n%n- To obtain Blizz Powder for Cryotheum, use your Fluid Transposer with Snowballs and Liquid XP.%n%n- To obtain Blitz Powder for Aerotheum, use your Fluid Transposer with Niter and Liquid XP. To get Niter, simply Pulverize Sandstone.%n%n- To get Basalz Powder for Petrotheum, use your Fluid Transposer with Pulverized Obsidian and Liquid XP.
dj2.quest.db.1196.title=Processor overload
dj2.quest.db.1196.desc=Use Mithril Ingots to create Operator Processors! These are used in Fluid Storage related AE2 items.
dj2.quest.db.1197.title=It takes everything
dj2.quest.db.1197.desc=Use your Arc Furnace or Alloy Smelter to craft some Mithril Ingots! It takes 1 Mana Dust, 1 Demonlord Ingot and 1 Platinum Ingot to craft one.
dj2.quest.db.1198.title=More energy storage options
dj2.quest.db.1198.desc=Craft a regular Energy Cell Frame and make it into an Energy Cell! You can upgrade them with Upgrade Kits, but it might be easier to craft them directly.
dj2.quest.db.1199.title=Dark and Energetic
dj2.quest.db.1199.desc=Create Refined Fuel using your Fractionating Still, then Fluid Transpose it onto some Dark Ingots to create Energized Dark Ingots!
dj2.quest.db.1200.title=Beats Psychic types
dj2.quest.db.1200.desc=Craft some Dark Ingots! You can find Bitumen underground. To obtain Tar, you can either:%n%n- Use a Fractionating Still with Oil (found underground), Crude Oil (obtained from Bitumen) or Liquifacted Coal (obtained from Pulverized Coal); or%n%n- Use DivineRPG Tar and Slimeballs in a Fluid Transposer.
dj2.quest.db.1201.title=Strengthen up!
dj2.quest.db.1201.desc=Upgrade an Extra Utilities Machine Block to a Thermal Expansion one!%n%nApply your various wrenches and similar tools to the rewarded Omniwand to easily swap between them.
dj2.quest.db.1202.title=More Processing time!
dj2.quest.db.1202.desc=Use some Coated Clathrate to create some Estimation Processors!
dj2.quest.db.1203.title=It's a gem, it's a pebble!
dj2.quest.db.1203.desc=Craft some Coated Clathrate either in the Induction Smelter or the Fluid Transposer!%n%nYou need to have visited the End for Resonant Clathrate.
dj2.quest.db.1204.title=It's so... shiny!
dj2.quest.db.1204.desc=Use Cinnabar and Nickel Ore in your Induction Smelter to get Platinum with 100%% chance!
dj2.quest.db.1205.title=Induction intentions
dj2.quest.db.1205.desc=Craft an Induction Smelter! With this machine, you can create alloys that only take 2 inputs. For these types (like Bronze, Electrum, Invar, or Vibrant Alloy), the Induction Smelter will do a great job, as it's really fast when fully upgraded.
dj2.quest.db.1206.title=Call yourself Bob Rosin
dj2.quest.db.1206.desc=Craft some Rosin in a Fractionating Still! To get Resin, use either an Arboreal Extractor (recommended, since it's free and will generate passively), or a Sawmill with a Resin Funnel Augment.
dj2.quest.db.1207.title=Ressin' around
dj2.quest.db.1207.desc=Craft a Resin Funnel Augment! Apply it to your Sawmill to be able to create Resin. Check which Wood types give Resin in JEI (simply check the usages for this Augment), since that's the type of fluid you'll need in the future.
dj2.quest.db.1208.title=Tree fluid, we glooin'
dj2.quest.db.1208.desc=Craft an Arboreal Extractor! To use it, place it next to the bottom of a naturally grown tree. Different tree types will provide different types of fluids, you are looking for Resin. To see which tree type gives which fluid, you can check the usages for the "Augment: Resin Funnel" item, since the same types of trees yield Resin in a Sawmill. However, I recommend this method for obtaining large amounts of Resin, since this is free and will passively generate.%n%nAdditionally, if you insert any type of Phyto-Gro into the left slot of the machine, you'll get double / triple / quadruple output from your Extractor.
dj2.quest.db.1209.title=Auto Crop Farms!
dj2.quest.db.1209.desc=Craft a Farming Station! Place it in the center of a crop field, give it power and a hoe, set its output, and watch it work! Auto crop farms, hurray!

dj2.quest.db.1212.title=Reinforce up!
dj2.quest.db.1212.desc=Craft a Device Frame! This is used in all the Thermal Expansion Devices (surprise-surprise), which are Machines that usually don't need any power to function.
dj2.quest.db.1213.title=Items & energy both needed?
dj2.quest.db.1213.desc=Combine Hardened Fluxducts and Itemducts to obtain some Signalum-Plated Itemducts. These pipes can transmit both power and items at the same time. You'll need to use Servos if you want to transmit items.
dj2.quest.db.1214.title=Some energy needed?
dj2.quest.db.1214.desc=Craft some of the most basic Fluxducts Thermal Expansion has to offer: The Leadstone Fluxducts! They can transmit RF Power, but not a lot of it.
dj2.quest.db.1215.title=The Ultimate Dust
dj2.quest.db.1215.desc=Craft together RF Powder, Pyrotheum Dust, Cryotheum Dust, Aerotheum Dust & Petrotheum Dust to obtain some Mana Dust!

dj2.quest.db.1216.desc=You haven't crafted enough Machine Frames yet, so for that reason, craft another. Lovely, isn't it!?
dj2.quest.db.1217.title=When Inducting doesn't cut it
dj2.quest.db.1217.desc=Craft a Basic Alloy Smelter! This is a cheaper version of the Arc Furnace in multiple cases, but it can only handle 3 inputs. But hey, 3 is more than what the Induction Smelter could handle!
dj2.quest.db.1218.title=Up-up-up-uppppgraaaade!!!
dj2.quest.db.1218.desc=Craft all 4 upgrade kits! Use them to upgrade a Basic machine to Resonant tier by Right Clicking on it! The advantage of upgrading the machine tier is that you can apply more Augments to the machine. While a Basic machine can only take one Augment, Hardened, Reinforced, Signalum, and Resonant machines can take three, five, seven, and nine Augments respectively. The most useful Augment is likely the Auxiliary Reception Coil, which speeds up the machine.
dj2.quest.db.1219.title=Can't turn off the tap!
dj2.quest.db.1219.desc=Upgrade your Fluid Conduits into Ender Fluid Conduits! These are one of the best types of Fluid Conduits available.
dj2.quest.db.1220.title=Turn on the tap!
dj2.quest.db.1220.desc=Craft some Fluid Conduits! Though not the best without upgrading them to the next tier, they can still be used in the same blockspace as Item & Energy Conduits.
dj2.quest.db.1221.title=4th way to crush
dj2.quest.db.1221.desc=Craft a Pulverizer! It's probably the best crushing machine you'll get, especially when fully upgraded to Resonant tier, and provided with 9 Auxiliary Reception Coil upgrades.%n%nYou can also easily setup its side configurations to input and output items from/to your storage.
dj2.quest.db.1222.title=Slicin', Splicin', and Sacrificin'
dj2.quest.db.1222.desc=Enticing pricing you have there... It's an Icing to the cake! Consider Slice'n'Splicing? If so, craft a Slice'n'Splice! Give it an Axe and some Shears (a good option is the Dark Steel variant for both), and sacrifice some mob skulls to craft some items with it! If you haven't made a Beheading Upgrade from Mob Grinding Utils yet, now would be a great time!
dj2.quest.db.1223.title=A lot of energy needed?
dj2.quest.db.1223.desc=Upgrade your Fluxducts all the way to the Resonant variant! This type of Fluxduct can transmit a lot of power!
dj2.quest.db.1224.title=HP from Mana
dj2.quest.db.1224.desc=Craft a Red Heart Canister! Your player can equip at most 10 of these and get 1 extra full Heart of health per Canister!
dj2.quest.db.1225.title=Fluidic Relocation
dj2.quest.db.1225.desc=Craft a Fluid Transposer! When used in conjunction with a Magma Crucible, you can use some kind of an input item and some kind of fluid provided by the Crucible to craft new items. This machine will be heavily used from now on, so make sure to at least semi-automate it. You can also craft Treated Wood and Coated Clathrate cheaper with this machine.%n%nSome recipes, particularly potion recipes, may not appear correctly in JEI. These recipes still function as you would expect, the issue is purely visual.
dj2.quest.db.1226.title=Fluids on the way!
dj2.quest.db.1226.desc=Craft some Hardened Fluiducts to be able to transport Fluids easily!
dj2.quest.db.1227.title=Rapid access!
dj2.quest.db.1227.desc=Craft some Signalum-Plated Impulse Itemducts by filling up the previous tier with Glowstone! Items travel more rapidly through Glowstone and you can still transmit power through this cable as well.
dj2.quest.db.1228.title=Capped off for more power
dj2.quest.db.1228.desc=Craft an Enhanced SAG Mill for even more crushing power!
dj2.quest.db.1229.title=Fortificate up!
dj2.quest.db.1229.desc=I heard you like Machine Chassis', so I put some Machine Chassis' in your Machine Chassis' so you can enjoy more Machine Chassis' along the way!
dj2.quest.db.1230.title=I saw. I milled. I conquered.
dj2.quest.db.1230.desc=Craft a Sawmill! This machine is capable of turning Wood into more Planks than simply crafting them in your Crafting Window, and is also capable of making Sawdust, used in some recipes.
dj2.quest.db.1231.title=Emperor of Empowerer
dj2.quest.db.1231.desc=Craft four of all 5 tiers of Empowered Dark Steel Upgrades! They can be applied to Dark Steel Armor one after another. These are needed for other upgrades and to make your armor set take energy instead of durability on hit.%n%nTo apply these upgrades, you need to use a Dark Steel Anvil. Simply have the armor piece equipped and use the tabs in the GUI of the Anvil to be able to apply them.%n%n§6Note:§r The 5th Empowered Tier is only applicable for End Steel and Stellar Armor.%n%n§6Note 2:§r This quest actually has 2 Tasks, you can either complete it by submitting the deactivated OR the activated Dark Steel Upgrades.
dj2.quest.db.1232.title=Riches get a great armor set
dj2.quest.db.1232.desc=Once you've accumulated a lot of Dark Steel and Enderium, you can make the best midgame armor set: The Dark Steel Set!%n%nNow, without upgrades you might not think this set is that powerful, but just type "Dark Steel Upgrade" into JEI to see the sheer amount of upgrade options available. Pretty much all of them are useful, so get on with the crafting!%n%nAlso, don't forget that this armor is still enchantable besides being upgradable.
dj2.quest.db.1233.title=Better than tanks
dj2.quest.db.1233.desc=Craft an 1k ME Fluid Storage Component! Making this into a Cell will allow you to store liquids in your ME System. You can access these with a Fluid Terminal.
dj2.quest.db.1234.title=Best way to enchant

Collect them!%n%nI wonder if you'll have to automate this process... Hmmm... (Yes, yes you do.)%n%nThen use the grains you've obtained to craft a Simple Machine Chassis from EnderIO!
dj2.quest.db.1237.title=One item after another
dj2.quest.db.1237.desc=Craft some Item Conduits! They are the EnderIO way to transport items, and probably one of the best ways in general, since they can be used in the same blockspace as other EnderIO Conduits. You can also use Extraction Speed Upgrades and Item Filters in them. You can also simply toggle Round Robin mode on to distribute items equally between outputs and turn Self Feed mode on to be able to push items back into the container you were pulling them from.
dj2.quest.db.1238.title=Tanks? Pfwah, get them out...
dj2.quest.db.1238.desc=Craft a 64k ME Fluid Storage Component!
dj2.quest.db.1239.title=A lot better than tanks
dj2.quest.db.1239.desc=Craft a 16k ME Fluid Storage Component!
dj2.quest.db.1240.title=Hoarding and sorting
dj2.quest.db.1240.desc=Craft a Basic Item Filter then upgrade it to an Advanced Item Filter. Apply them to your Item Conduits and guess what they do...!%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%nNo, I'm not gonna tell you. You really have to guess.
dj2.quest.db.1241.title=I'll Swallow Your Soul!
dj2.quest.db.1241.desc=Craft a Soul Binder! Use Soul Vials with mob souls inside and other input items to infuse the soul into the item! Spooky!
dj2.quest.db.1242.title=Caught you!
dj2.quest.db.1242.desc=Craft a Soul Vial! Use it to catch mobs. You can later use them for crafting with the Soul Binder, or soon enough - to automatically spawn more of them... See Chapter 13: Ender Upgrades.
dj2.quest.db.1243.title=4th way to smelt
dj2.quest.db.1243.desc=Craft a Redstone Furnace! It's a pretty great smelting machine, especially when fully upgraded to Resonant tier, and provided with 9 Auxiliary Reception Coil upgrades.%n%nYou can also easily set up its side configurations to input and output items from/to your storage.
dj2.quest.db.1244.title=External Fluid Storage
dj2.quest.db.1244.desc=Instead of crafting Fluid Storage Cells, you can choose to store your Fluids in external tanks or drums that might have a larger capacity. For this purpose, you can use an ME Fluid Storage Bus.
dj2.quest.db.1245.title=Like a stewpot, but hotter
dj2.quest.db.1245.desc=Craft a Magma Crucible! This machine can turn many solid items into its liquid form. You'll mostly need to use it to provide various liquids for the Fluid Transposer.

dj2.quest.db.1247.desc=You thought the Alloy Smelter was gonna be that slow?! Well, no longer! Introducing: The Enhanced Alloy Smelter, which is more than twice as fast.
dj2.quest.db.1248.title=Accessing your fluids
dj2.quest.db.1248.desc=Craft a Fluid Terminal! Through this you can see all stored Fluids in your ME System, and manually import and export a couple of buckets at once. Though I recommend Fluid Export and Import Buses for this job, especially if you're working with larger amounts.
dj2.quest.db.1249.title=Upgraded and stronger
dj2.quest.db.1249.desc=Smelt some Dark Steel in your Basic Alloy Smelter to be able to craft an actual Alloy Smelter! This machine can be upgraded with Capacitors for faster production.
dj2.quest.db.1250.title=Got a cold
dj2.quest.db.1250.desc=Craft a Glacial Precipitator! With this machine, you can automatically create Snow, Ice, or Packed Ice out of Water! Simply feed it Water with an Aqueous Accumulator, an Unending Bowl, or an Endervoir, give it some power and watch it work!
dj2.quest.db.1251.title=Banking the power

They were masters of a technique no one far and wide has ever even thought of...! The masters of Ore Creation.%n%nThey used Darkstone and refined Graphite to give back mother nature what hath been taketh away.%n%nThey indeed had mother nature herself on their side. With this knowledge, they waited for troops from the invading country. They waited patiently until one day, knights had arrived from the distance. The sun barely came up, but they were ready nonetheless.%n%nThey asked for Mother Nature because they knew she would listen... And mother nature provided. She created a massive earthquake that shook the knights off their horses! They got so scared they never returned.%n%nThat day would later be called "The Origin of the Oregen" and be celebrated each year thereafter.%n%nCome, embrace the knowledge of the villagers, and create some Graphite Ore to please mother nature!%n%nThe End

It has 4 slots for items to craft, a slot in the center for the crafting result, a bar to display crafting progress, and a space for a Tartaric Gem.%n%nThis machine is crucial to automate, so here is a step by step guide on how to do so most efficiently for items that take multiple of the same inputs (like the Air Reagent).%n%nThe issue is that the input Glass Bottles stack, not allowing you to start the craft. There are two solutions for this. The first method is to use Integrated Dynamics:%n%n§lStep 1.§r Set up an ME Interface on Blocking Mode into a Chest.%n%n§lStep 2.§r Connect an Item Interface to it, and set 4 Item Exporters onto the Hellfire Forge, then in "Export All Items" -> set each to a distinct slot (0, 1, 2, 3, respectively), Quantity to 1. This makes it so items will be placed evenly between slots.%n%n§lStep 3.§r Make 4 Variable Cards (an empty variable card is considered "True") and add one to each Item Exporter in the "Export All Items" slot.%n%n§lStep 4.§r To extract, use an Item Filter for the outputs or use an Item Importer to import from Slot 5.%n%nThe second method is to use item renaming:%n%n§lStep 1.§r Make an Inscriber Name Press. This can be done by crafting a Certus Quartz or Nether Quartz Cutting Knife, right click to open up its GUI, place in an Iron Ingot and rename it to something.%n%n§lStep 2.§r Place the Name Press inside an Inscriber and connect it to your system through an ME Interface. This can be used to rename any input item to the desired name.%n%n§lStep 3.§r Create a Pattern that renames the item you need multiple of (for example, a Glass Bottle) to your desired name, then automatically pull the Bucket out of your Interface and transfer it to the Hellfire Forge automation setup.%n%n§lStep 4.§r Create a Pattern for an item you'd like to automate that uses one renamed item and one regular item (for example, the Air Reagent uses 2 Glass Bottles - one should be renamed, one can stay unnamed).%n%n§lStep 5.§r Connect an ME Interface to a Chest that's next to your Hellfire Forge. This Chest will receive the input ingredients. Connect the Chest to the Hellfire Forge with a Limited Item Filter, and filter for both the renamed and regular input items. All other items can be inserted with a separate Item Conduit or on a separate channel.%n%n§lNote:§r You'll get access to full Will automation in Chapter 17.

dj2.quest.db.1585.title=Musical Instruments
dj2.quest.db.1585.desc=To complete the quest, craft 2 Totemist Drums! Read on for more information about Musical Instruments and Ceremonies:%n%nTo start a Ceremony, you need to be close to a Totem Pole. Place down some Drums (2 is likely enough), lots of Wind Chimes, and hold some musical instruments in your main- and off-hand like a Flute, and later a Rattle and an Eagle-Bone Whistle.%n%nTo actually begin a Ceremony, Shift+Right Click with or on a musical instrument. Check the Ceremonies Chapter of your Totempedia for a detailed explanation on each Ceremony. It shows you which instrument(s) you need to Shift+Right Click on, to start a certain Ritual.%n%nThe first Ritual it explains is the War Dance. If you haven't played with Totemic yet, I recommend you try it: Shift+Right Click twice on a Drum to start it. Now you'll see two bars on your screen slowly filling up. You need to fill up the top bar, before your time runs out: which is measured on the bottom bar. To use musical instruments, simply Right Click with or on them. You should see the top bar filling up.%n%nIf you do it successfully, you'll earn the benefits of the given Ritual; in the case of the War Dance, Strength and Speed for 3 minutes.%n%nFailing a Ritual? There can be multiple things going wrong:%n%n1. Each musical instrument has a short cooldown to use, so you can't just spam one Drum and expect the Ritual to complete.%n%n2. Variety helps! Try using a Flute besides the Drum, constantly swapping between the two. Note: You can click the Drum while holding the Flute.%n%n3. For even more complex Ceremonies, try crafting passive music generating instruments: Wind Chimes, as well as a Jingle Dress, which you can move around with to generate more music.
dj2.quest.db.1586.title=Chime! Wait For Me!
dj2.quest.db.1586.desc=Craft 3 Wind Chimes. Hang them up near your Totem Pole for passive music generation. Watch out though, you should have no blocks beneath a Chime!%n%nChime congestion:%n- Chimes, when placed, count the number of Chimes in a 17x17x17 cube area centered on themselves; if there are 3 or more OTHER chimes, then it becomes "congested".%n- Chimes, when broken, cause every other Chime in their 17x17x17 cube to re-check for congestion.%n- Congested chimes are useless. You can tell one is congested because it drops white spark particles constantly.%n- Effectively this means that every 17x17x17 cube can only have 3 useful chimes in it at once.%n%nChime music contribution:%n- A Chime (and all other instruments and entities playing instruments) must be in a sphere with radius of 8 blocks of a totem pole to actually contribute to a dance started around that totem.%n- This means that it's possible to place TWELVE chimes around a totem pole if you follow the diagram seen below. Note that due to congestion checking mechanics, you need to place the corner chimes last in order for all of them to not be congested.%n%n%n§6██§r███████§6██%n█§r█████████§6█§r%n███████████%n███████████%n███████████%n█████§8█§r█████%n███████████%n███████████%n███████████%n§6█§r█████████§6█%n██§r███████§6██§r%n%nwhere%n%n§6█§r §r=§r a Chime%n§8█§r §r=§r a Totem pole%n█ §r=§r any other block%n%nChime music generation:%n- A Chime has two states, Playing and Cooldown.%n- Playing state lasts 10 seconds, and contributes 2 melody to the dance every 2 seconds (including at 0 and 10 seconds) for a total of 5x2 §r=§r 10 melody.%n- Cooldown state lasts an average of 40 seconds, but reasonably likely to be in 30-50 second range.%n- If the chime is hanging from leaves, then instead of contributing 2 melody, it contributes 2 + random[0,2] melody (those are §oinclusive§r bounds) for an average of 3 melody instead.%n- Across all chimes, they can only contribute a maximum of 25 melody throughout the course of a dance. (Note that every instrument has the same mechanic, each TYPE has a maximum amount that they can contribute, so it's useless to craft more than like 2 or 3 drums because you'll just max out on them really fast anyways). So, the main point of having more Chimes is to ensure that you get all 25 melody out of it due to the rng nature of their activation.%n- The 25 melody max from Chimes is actually quite small, but it is necessary for the final Ritual. (Flute max is 50 for example.) Baykok requires 251 melody to summon, and the maximum amount of melody that you can possibly generate with ALL the instruments is 270, so that 25 from the chimes IS required (in fact all the instruments are required for it!)%n%n§oThank you to ToasterKoishi for the info!§r%n

dj2.quest.db.1666.desc=Craft a Ritual Diviner [Dusk]! This will let you set up higher-tier Rituals, which you'll need a lot of to progress.
dj2.quest.db.1667.title=Optionally bind them too!
dj2.quest.db.1667.desc=Craft some Bound Tools! The only one you'll need for progression is the Bound Pickaxe which will let you break and collect Ethaxium in Omothol - right after finishing this Chapter... So no need to hurry with this one!%n%nTo activate one of these tools, simply press Shift+Right Click. Each tool drains LP from your Soul Network while it's active and consumes additional LP on use. Be careful!
dj2.quest.db.1668.title=Kling! Swoop! Chop!
dj2.quest.db.1668.desc=Craft some Manasteel Tools. These will later be upgraded into Bound Tools, which have a high Mining level and can break Ethaxium in Omothol. However, you won't necessarily need them before finishing this chapter.
dj2.quest.db.1669.title=This is where being hemophobic truly sucks...
dj2.quest.db.1669.desc=Slay enough mobs and obtain enough Weak Blood Shards to be able to craft 5 Large Bloodstone Tiles! Use 4 of them to upgrade your Blood Altar to Tier 4 and the remaining one to obtain a Tier 4 Blood Orb!%n%nYou can also duplicate Weak Blood Shards with a Tier 4 Slate once you build up the Altar.%n%nIf you're unsure of the Altar's construction, check this site: https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Altar
dj2.quest.db.1670.title=The last piece

dj2.quest.db.1674.title=Ouchy! Don't put this on your head.
dj2.quest.db.1674.desc=Loot four Effulgent Apalachian Spikes and combine them... Now what could this yield?
dj2.quest.db.1675.title=Tier 4 Reagents
dj2.quest.db.1675.desc=Craft all four Tier 4 Essences. Try to semi-automate them for now; very soon you'll have access to Will automation as well.
dj2.quest.db.1676.title=Will-ing to pay a price

dj2.quest.db.1678.title=Finally! Its light shines through!
dj2.quest.db.1678.desc=Craft a Beacon! You'll eventually need 4 of them to upgrade your Blood Magic Altar to Tier 5! No need to hurry though. Either explore more of Atum for its crafting ingredients or Apalachia dungeons for Radiant Beacons. Also remember to kill Withers for Nether Stars!
dj2.quest.db.1679.title=Swole Soul
dj2.quest.db.1679.desc=Now that you have access to Will Crystals, craft a Greater Tartaric Gem! Isn't it Great? (-er.)
dj2.quest.db.1680.title=One's June, the other's Rune!
dj2.quest.db.1680.desc=Create all 4 Tier 2 Runes!%n%nIt's getting complicated....%n%nGuess what I'm gonna recommend you...... Yes, automate these as well. All of their ingredients too. Now go!
dj2.quest.db.1681.title=Get Wild in Apalachia

dj2.quest.db.1682.title=What's the matter? (This.)
dj2.quest.db.1682.desc=Place any 8 Dimensional Dirt types near your Daisy and wait 30 seconds to obtain Livingmatter!%n%nYou definitely want to automate this with something such as ME Annihilation and Formation Planes.
dj2.quest.db.1683.title=Call the Storm
dj2.quest.db.1683.desc=Summon the Thunder! Either craft a Spectre of Thunder, which is a single-use item that lets you create a Thunderstorm, or use EnderIO's Weather Obelisk with some Concentrated Cloud Seed. Once you've done that, capture the storm in an Environmental Accumulator (found all around the Overworld) for an ingredient in the Awakened Activation Crystal!%n%nIf you're having trouble finding an Environmental Accumulator, drop a Dark Stick on the ground and follow its lead!
dj2.quest.db.1684.title=Light your way!
dj2.quest.db.1684.desc=Craft a Sigil of the Blood Lamp! This is my personal favorite Sigil, letting you light up areas from a distance by shooting little invisible Blood Lamp thingamadoohickies. No more Torches!
dj2.quest.db.1685.title=Make the Slate and don't be Late
dj2.quest.db.1685.desc=Craft a couple Tier 4 (Demonic) Blood Magic Slates!%n%nThis is a good point to take your time and automate all available Slates up to this point. You can create an elaborate timing system for each one, or simply multiple Altars with specific filters on the outputs.%n%nThe easiest way is to create 2 Altars, with alternating Slate crafting: filter the outputs for Tier 1 and 3 Slates on one of them, and Tier 2 and 4 Slates on the other, and use ME Interfaces as inputs. This system will always reliably craft the wanted Slate, even if an insufficient amount of Blood is available. You can later expand it to Tier 5 and 6 Slates... and beyond!?
dj2.quest.db.1686.title=My blood for your blood!
dj2.quest.db.1686.desc=Bind a Blade to your Soul! (I'm suuuure your Soul will be fiiiine after so don't worry about it!)%n%nTo activate it, press Shift+Right Click. But be wary, while its active, it will drain LP from your Soul Network. Ouch!
dj2.quest.db.1687.title=It stays sharp forever!
dj2.quest.db.1687.desc=Craft a Manasteel Sword! It's the most important tool for progression at this point.
dj2.quest.db.1688.title=With 20/20 vision
dj2.quest.db.1688.desc=Upgrade your Divination Sigil into a Seer's Sigil. This shows additional information when Right Clicked on a Blood Altar, namely the current progress and the LP consumption rate.

dj2.quest.db.1690.title=Activation!
dj2.quest.db.1690.desc=Craft a Weak Activation Crystal! Bind it to yourself by Shift+Right Clicking in the air. By Right Clicking on a Master Ritual Stone, you can sacrifice some of the LP stored in your Life Network to activate the Ritual.%n%nIf it's not working, any of the following may be the culprit:%n- The Ritual isn't set up correctly. Maybe you need more Ritual Stones?%n- You need an Awakened Activation Crystal.%n- You don't have enough LP in your Life Network.
dj2.quest.db.1691.title=Get in the Flow(er)!
dj2.quest.db.1691.desc=Make some Endoflames! Provide them with Coal for Mana Generation. Check if they're connected to a nearby Mana Spreader using your Wand of the Forest.%n%nYou definitely want to automate this with Droppers on a Timer dropping Coal Blocks.
dj2.quest.db.1692.title=We're really going deep this time...
dj2.quest.db.1692.desc=Craft Cha'garoth's R'lyehian Gateway Key! This will let you create any AbyssalCraft portal by Right Clicking (for the next Portal) or Shift+Right Clicking (for the previous Portal). Use it in the Dreadlands to create a Portal to Omothol!
dj2.quest.db.1693.title=Cha'garoth's final words
dj2.quest.db.1693.desc=Defeat Cha'garoth to obtain his Dread-plagued Gateway Key! You can't directly use this to escape the Dreadlands, so hopefully you still know where your portal is...%n%nContinue with the quests to be able to upgrade it to an actual functional key!
dj2.quest.db.1694.title=Will you do this for me?
dj2.quest.db.1694.desc==================================%n      AUTOMATING WILL GENERATION%n=================================%n%nIn this quest, I will provide you with information on how to setup automatic Will generation. You can choose to either read on, or watch this incredible tutorial video:%n%nhttps://youtu.be/K25QmSmfTRA%n%n(If §ryou can't copy the link, simply search for the title of the video: "Blood Magic - Demon Will Automation Tutorial" by Marzule Streams.) Another video for automating Will is https://youtu.be/bhiENn59JbM.%n%nIf you chose to read on, here is a step by step breakdown on how to create infinite Blood Magic Will and Will Crystals:%n%n§lSTEP 1.§r Obtain a couple Common Tartaric Gems with at least a couple thousand Will overall, and have at least 1,000,000 LP in your Life Network. Make sure to have every step of Ritual Stone crafting fully automated, except for automatic Will collection for Reagents. (This means you need to fully automate Tenebrae and Void Reagent creation. After this setup, you won't need to worry about your Tartaric Gems running out either.)%n%n§lSTEP 2.§r Press F9 to see the chunk borders. Make this build entirely in ONE chunk, because Will is stored in Minecraft's chunks separately.%n%n§lSTEP 3.§r You have 2 options here: Use a couple Powered Spawners to spawn passive animals in the chunk; or use Cursed Earth to spawn hostile mobs.%n%n§lSTEP 4.§r Go up about 4-5 blocks from your last setup or the floor of your Powered Spawner room and place another Master Ritual Stone. Setup the Gathering of Forsaken Souls Ritual with your Ritual Diviner [Dusk] here. Activate it with your Awakened Activation Crystal.%n%n§lSTEP 5.§r Place a solid block on top of your previous Master Ritual Stone, and place another Master Ritual Stone on top. Setup the Resonance of the Faceted Crystal Ritual with your Ritual Diviner [Dusk] on this one. Also activate it with your Awakened Activation Crystal. This will interlock wi§tth the Ritual below.%n%n§lSTEP 6.§r Place a Demon Crystallizer on top of the most recent Master Ritual Stone.%n%n§lSTEP 7.§r Build a platform out of solid blocks on the highest level of Ritual Stones, so that your Demon Crystallizer is the only thing poking out.%n%n§lSTEP 8.§r Place 5 Demon Crucibles somewhere on your platform. Place some Tartaric Gems that contain at least a couple hundred points of Will into some of the Demon Crucibles.%n%n§lSTEP 9.§r (Optional, but recommended.) Make a Demon Will Aura Gauge. It shows you the amount of Will stored in the Chunk (on the first bar, because we're creating regular Will for now). A Chunk can only hold up to 100 Will. The Demon Crucibles keep this filled up while the Resonance of the Faceted Crystal Ritual drains this and creates Will crystals.%n%n§lSTEP 10.§r It's a waiting game now! Wait until a regular Demon Crystal forms on top of your Demon Crystallizer, then splits, then creates 4 types of colored Demon Will Crystals nearby, then those split as well. If you see a total of 5 clusters of crystals with 6 spikes each, you're done. If you have to wait for a long time but still see no results, check your Demon Will Aura Gauge to see if you have run out of Will. If so, refill your Tartaric Gem(s) in the Demon Crucible(s).%n%n§lSTEP 11.§r Collect your crystal clusters and break your Demon Crystallizer. Use a Ritual Dismantler to also get rid of the topmost Ritual (Resonance of the Faceted Crystal). Simply Right Click twice, but don't accidentally hit the Rituals below. If parts of your platform are missing, replace those.%n%n§lSTEP 12.§r Place 5 Drawers or Barrels nearby. Place each type of Will Crystal you just collected in its own separate Drawer/Barrel, then lock them with a Drawer Key / Storage Key.%n%n§lSTEP 13.§r Now you can reclaim your Tartaric Gem(s) from the Demon Crucible(s). Then place a Hellfire Forge somewhere on your platform (in the same chunk). Place a Tartaric Gem inside (into the right slot) with a fair amount of Will. This can also suck up any excess Will you have in the chunk (up to 100). Then remove your Tartaric Gem from your Hellfire Forge, so it no longer sucks up the regular Demon Will from the chunk.%n%n§lSTEP 14.§r Take 4 pieces of each of the Will Crystals from your Drawers / Barrels and use your Hellfire Forge to create a placeable Crystal Cluster of each type.%n%n§lSTEP 15.§r Place down all 5 Crystal Clusters you just crafted somewhere on your platform (still in the same chunk).%n%n§lSTEP 16.§r Connect your Drawers / Barrels to your Demon Crucibles the following way: Each Drawer / Barrel should be connected to its own Crucible, and the Drawers / Barrels should be able to accept additional items. You can do this with a single line of EnderIO Item Conduits and 5 unique channel colors. Don't forget to set the Drawer / Barrel side to Extract (Always Active) on a specific channel and Insert on Green, and the Crucible side to Insert on the corresponding channel.%n%n§lSTEP 17.§r Hop down below your platform and place yet another Master Ritual Stone below the one that's doing the Gathering of Forsaken Souls Ritual (built in STEP 4 - right below your platform). Use a Ritual Diviner [Dusk] to build the Crack of the Fractured Crystal Ritual, which interlocks with the previous Rituals. Activate it with your Awakened Activation Crystal.%n%n§lSTEP 18.§r Place a Vacuum Chest with an Item Filter right above your Crystal Clusters somewhere. Set the Item Filter to collect the Demon Crystals that are popping off right now.%n%n§lSTEP 19.§r Extract your Vacuum Chest's inventory to your Drawers / Barrels.%n%n§lSTEP 20.§r Congratulations! Your setup is now self-sustaining. Each type of Will Crystal will slowly move to a Demon Crucible, which fills up the Chunk with a particular type of Will, which let your placed down Crystal Clusters grow. Of course this is a farm, so Crystal growth is faster than the Crystals being used up. However be careful not to use up ALL your Crystals of a certain type. If you do so, Crystal generation of that type will stop. If you also don't have a Tartaric Gem of the specific type of will, then you'll unfortunately have to start again from STEP 5, building the Resonance of the Faceted Crystal Ritual. Otherwise, simply stick your Tartaric Gem of the correct type in the Demon Crucible that's missing its Crystal and wait for the Will in the chunk to regenerate.%n%n§lSTEP 21.§r Once you have a fully self-sustaining setup (probably around 100 Crystals of each type), you can place your Tartaric Gem back into your Hellfire Forge to automatically keep it filled up with Will. You might want to automate Hellfire Forge recipes in this Chunk, so you'll never have to refill your Tartaric Gems again. The Hellfire Forge is kinda finicky with its inputs and outputs, it only lets you input in this order: The outer 4 items first, then the Tartaric Gem, then the central item (although you should never push items into there). Blocking mode won't work, because Tartaric Gem is seen as an item in the Hellfire Forge's inventory. To get around this you have 2 options: Periodically pull out the Tartaric Gem and immediately push it back. The period it stays in the Hellfire Forge should last slightly longer than 1 operation of it. Alternatively, use an Impulse Hopper with a Timer to push items into the Forge. Pull out items on a Filter, and don't forget to also pull out Empty Buckets.%n%n§lSTEP 22. (OPTIONAL)§r You can create the same exact setup in multiple chunks, or even the same chunk (and I recommend it). Just watch your Will levels with your Demon Will Aura Gauge. If they start decreasing, it's probably best to move to another chunk.
dj2.quest.db.1695.title=Shoot!

dj2.quest.db.1698.title=Thicker veins
dj2.quest.db.1698.desc=Craft some Runes of Augmented Capacity. Each one increases the Blood Altar's capacity by 10%%, multiplicatively.%n%nThey aren't a straight upgrade over your previous Capacity Runes, however as they grant a multiplicative increase, they scale much better than their earlier counterparts.%n%nIt comes out to having 15 Augmented Capacity Runes is slightly better than 15 Runes of Capacity, and from that point, including 1 Augmented Capacity Rune is better (later much better) than 1 Rune of Capacity.%n%nMeaning that if you have at least 15 Augmented Capacity Runes, you should only use them from that point on.%n%nNot displayed here is the Efficiency Rune, which reduces the decay of progress of crafts if you run out of blood. Its not particularly useful.

dj2.quest.db.1707.title=THIS IS ESSENTIAL.
dj2.quest.db.1707.desc=---------------------------%n§lHOW TO AUTOMATE ESSENTIA§r%n---------------------------%n(Prior version by @jehlpxyz, @legendcrazyman, and @ming3012)%n%nAutomating essentia is a difficult project, but with the Thaumic Energistics fork it gets a lot easier.%n%nYou have three ways to do this, and we'll cover all of them.%n%nFirst, you can do the lazy way. Craft a large amount of 64k Essentia Storage Cells and design something to smelt resources for thousands upon thousands of each essentia, and call it complete. You would have to add more Storage Cells and Drives as the pack goes on, and this would require semi-regular manual attention, but it's easy. You can import Essentia into your network by attaching an Essentia Import Bus directly to an Arcane Alembic.%n%nSecond, you can automate Essentia digitally. Just place down enough smelteries for the amount of items you want to smelt for all the essentia types and import the essentia with an essentia import bus on the alembic into a filtered essentia cell anywhere on your network. Then you want to set the drives with the partitioned essentia storage cells at a lower priority and setup 41 void jars with filtered essentia storage buses on them for each type of essentia. Finally, you can then setup a comparator reading each void jar and setup logic to turn off the insert of items if a particular essentia type has filled up the void jar.%n%nThird, you can setup 41 essentia smelteries on their own subnetwork with 1 item per essentia type feeding into a drive and voiding any essentia that you do not want in that subnetwork with void jars. Then you can export from each subnetwork into a jar with a essentia storage bus on the main network reading the contents of the jars.%n%nThere are plenty of things that you can do to improve upon the efficiency of any of these systems, but these are the core ideas necessary to get any of them to work.

dj2.quest.db.1710.desc=Craft a Fortune Quarry Shape Card! You'll get Fortuned outputs from your Builder when using this Shape Card.
dj2.quest.db.1711.title=Very Touching
dj2.quest.db.1711.desc=Craft a Silk Touch Quarry Shape Card! You'll get Silk Touched outputs from your Builder when using this Shape Card.%n%nBe aware that using this in the Overworld will result in many-many different Underground Biomes Ore variants for each of the Ores, so I recommend using this specifically in the Nether or the Deep Dark.
dj2.quest.db.1712.title=Even more Primordierer
dj2.quest.db.1712.desc=Craft a Goddess' Pearl! This is an infinite durability Primordial Pearl.

dj2.quest.db.1718.desc=While the "small" crate only stores 9 more slots, to a total of 117 stacks, it has other ways it is superior to a chest:%n- It is a full block, and can be opened while under a solid block%n- It can be upgraded to a medium and large size, which store *2 and *3 compared to the "small"%n- Using the Storage Crate Keeper, unlocked in Chapter 3, it can be moved around much easier than chests.
dj2.quest.db.1719.title=Blanking Out
dj2.quest.db.1719.desc=Craft an Arcane Inscriber, a Blank Knowledge Core, and an Arcane Assembler. Place the Blank Knowledge Core on the rightmost side of the Arcane Inscriber, place the desired recipe in the terminal (use JEI's +), and then save it to an empty slot in the Knowledge Core. Each Knowledge Core can have 9 recipes saved to it. Once you have loaded all desired recipes into the Knowledge Core, place it in the Arcane Assembler.%n%nNote: The Arcane Assembler will consume enormous amounts of vis, and if it cannot consume vis it will silently stall. The same thing applies to Vis Crystals, as it draws them directly from the network as-needed, rather than being part of the recipe pattern.
dj2.quest.db.1720.title=Base moving time?
dj2.quest.db.1720.desc=The Medium Storage Crate stores 234 stacks. Placing the Storage Crate Keeper in any size of Storage Crate will let the Storage Crate keep its inventory when broken - although it will be expended doing this, so make sure you don't place it early.

dj2.quest.db.1721.desc=Craft the components for a Lightning Rod! This is another great source of power, like the Diesel Generator. This multiblock has a chance to create a lightning strike on itself during rain or thunderstorms to produce a burst of power, which you can then extract. The multiblock only works with its own lightning system, not Vanilla Lightning. %n%nCheck your Engineer's Manual -> Power, Wires, Generators -> Lightning Rod to see how to build this multiblock. To form it, click on any of the Light Engineering Blocks. To increase the chance of a lightning strike, add a ring of steel fences on the top of the multiblock. To go higher move the ring of steel fences up and place a pillar of steel fences up on the middle top of the multiblock. You can do this up to build height. You can also share the same steel fence ring with other Lightning Rods. Now that is called Peak Efficiency!  %n%n§W§cWARNING: Do NOT build this on a chunk border. Press F9 twice to show them. If built on a chunk border, eventually the machine could get corrupted and crash your world.%n

dj2.quest.db.1729.title=ManaVision 20!!
dj2.quest.db.1729.desc=Mana Spreaders shoot a burst of mana every time they contain mana and do not have a mana burst currently traveling.
