## Mod Modifications:
- Applied Energistics rv6-stable-7 Omni v47 -> rv6-stable-7 Extended Life v50 (This should fix the issue where AE2 randomly goes out for a second.)
- ExtraCells 2.6.5 -> ExtraCells2 - SamLam140330's Fork 2.6.7 (This fixes multiple issues with Gas Storage Components and the Gas Level Emitter.)

## Bugfixes:

- MysticalWorld Quartz Ore can now be processed in the SAG Mill.
- Removed and hid Cha'rcoal (the Abyssalcraft Charcoal). Dreadlands Wood now smelts into regular Charcoal.
- Changed Roots "Open Spell Library" default keybind from K to Shift+O, so it doesn't conflict with anything.
- Sacthoth's Soul Reaper Blade no longer loses its enchantments when Souls are extracted from it.
- SAG Milling Destabilized Redstone Ore no longer produces Abyssalcraft Crystallized Redstone.
- RFTools Worlds can no longer contain Flux Goo. Also removed its Dimlet.

## Balance Adjustments:

- The new AE2 version added a 4x4 Processing Pattern-only encoder, called an ME Extended Processing Pattern Terminal. Added a recipe for it.
- Reenabled Gas Storage Cells and the ME Gas Level Emitter.
- The Alchemical Machine Frame now requires 32,000 RF/tick instead of 128,000 RF/tick so an unupgraded Laser Focus does not eat up the item.
- All ContentTweaker, DraconicEvolution and PlusTiC Laser Focus recipes now require 1/10th of the previously used Mekanism Laser Energy, so the crafts are done much faster.
- RFTools Worlds can no longer generate EvilCraft Blood, and also disabled its Dimlet. (Worlds could freeze up and crash as millions of EvilCraft Blood blocks solidify.)
- Added a custom recipe for the ME OreDict Storage Bus that was added with the newest version of AE2.
- Reworked the Auto Infusion Matrix. Essentia Input Hatches no longer touch each other. Its structure only changed slightly (36 -> 41 (+5), Ancient Lanterns: 9 -> 8 (-1), Fortified Glass: 9 -> 44 (+35)). Altered its quest to reflect this. It now crafts items 5x faster. Thank you to WaitingIdly for most of this!

## QoL Improvements:

- Hid more filled Fluid Patterns in JEI to reduce clutter.
- Unhid the Efficiency Rune in JEI.
- Unhid the Florb of Empowered Oil and Liquid Death in JEI, since they are specifically needed for crafts.
