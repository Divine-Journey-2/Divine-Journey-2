## Mod Modifications:

- Replaced LootTweaker 0.3.0 with the "old-parser" version, as the previously used version has been removed from CurseForge.

## Balance Adjustments:

- Added a new Modular Machine called "Lightningcraft Infusion Multiblock", which does the same as the Lightning Infusion Table, except faster and without huge TPS issues. It will also be required to create some of the LightningCraft materials. Also adjusted the LightningCraft questline to support it. (This change has been made by WaitingIdly. Thank you!)
