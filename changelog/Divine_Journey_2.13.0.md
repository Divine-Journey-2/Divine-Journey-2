## Mod Modifications:

- AE2 Unofficial Extended Life v51d -> v51e (This fixes autocrafting not recognizing simulated returned items properly (like empty Buckets).)
- Replaced ReAuth 3.6.0 with OAuth 1.06.3. (This fixes not being able to relog with Microsoft accounts.)
- Added the Better P2P Mod. (This lets you see and find connected P2P tunnels in-world.) Also added a quest for it in Chapter 6.

## Bugfixes:

- Reverted the change from 2.11.0 that added Skyroot Planks to the plankWood OreDict. Now Skyroot Buckets are craftable again.
- The Mob Loot Fabricator Blood Magic recipe no longer incorrectly shows that it outputs LP.
- Fixed an issue where an empty Shulker Box that has been placed down and picked back up couldn't be upgraded into Iron Shulker Box.

## Balance Adjustments:

- Added Hooves to the Mob Loot Fabricator Bewitchment output.

## QoL Improvements:

- Different tier EnderIO Conduits can now connect to each other.
- Pulsating Iron is now craftable in the Arc Furnace.
- Pereskia Bulbs can now also be used to make Plant Oil in the Squeezer.

## Text and Quest Updates:

- Updated the Blood Altar link in the Chapter 17 Large Bloodstone Tile quest.
- Renamed the Chapter 3 Grove Stone quest and the Chapter 15 Cracked and Clean Runic Plate quests to avoid confusion.
