## Mod Modifications:

- Updated to Roots 3.1.1.
- Added Spark, an alternative to LagGoggles, since latter is incompatible with the current mod versions.
- Added Simply Backpacks. Iron Backpacks have multiple known duplication bugs, so we're slowly phasing them out. Replaced all recipes that use Iron Backpacks to use Simply Backpacks. Added custom recipes for all Simply Backpacks, and removed all Iron Backpack recipes. For now, existing Iron Backpacks will stay ingame, but new ones won't be craftable.
