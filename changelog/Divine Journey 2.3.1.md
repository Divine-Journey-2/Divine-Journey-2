REMINDER: Iron Backpacks are being phased out. They will be removed in a later version, so move your items into Simply Backpacks.



For server owners: I recommend regenerating Wildwood after this change by deleting all files under world/WildWood/region and restarting the server.



- Fixed Mekanism Tanks not being upgradable once they've been placed down.
- Fixed Mystical World huts spawning the wrong kind of Copper.
- Nether Reed can now be used to make Paper.
- Added Osmium Ore to the IE Excavator.
- Energized Osmium and Energized Certus can no longer be crafted with containers. I'll reenable this once I figure out how to make the recipes use up the Biodiesel in Crafting Terminals.
- Changed the max stack size of Mekanism Speed, Energy and Gas Upgrades from 8 to 64.
- Changed the recipe of the Large Nether Brick tile, as it was conflicting with the Nether Brick from Slabs recipe.
- The /dev/null now takes 4 Papers instead of 4 Open Ingots.
- Oil Sand and Coralium Ores can now be mined up from any Biome using the Laser Drill.
- Solar Panel II now crafts 4 at a time, and all Solar Panels from III craft 2 at a time (up from 1).
- Added a recipe for Wildwood Saplings.
- Sand in the Pulverized can now be made into Gravel.
- Disabled the Soulium Dagger. Mob Chunks are only meant to be gotten through crafting.
- Removed the unnecessary phospor.cfg since the mod was removed previously.
- Fixed an exploit that let players copy any block in the Wildwood dungeon if they somehow reached the hidden room. The clone command now filters for Andesite or other stones only.
- Fixed an exploit that let players covert between any of the Ores using DankNulls.
- Fixed an exploit that let players duplicate any item using the IF Mob Duplicator. Now Excact Copy mode is set to false.
- Fixed a progression skip that let players obtain Primordial Pearls and Garmonbozia early from Thaumcraft structures. Had to disable the Hollow Hill structures for this. (Unfortunately there is no way to disable just the Urns from them, or change the loot table of the Urns.)
- Fixed a progression skip by disabling Thaumcraft Pechs. They could have given various Thaumcraft items that should only be available from Chapter 19.
- Fixed the misinformation in Chapter 3 about the Runed items not autorepairing.
- The Crystal Growth Accelerator quest in Chapter 6 now only asks for 2 instead of 5.
- Fixed unbalanced quest rewards in the "Always been bits" quests in Chapter 13.
- The Ender Lasso quest no longer gives a Mob Imprisonment Tool as its reward in Chapter 13.
- Added a missing character in Chapter 30.
- Added a tooltip on the Imp Leather that Imps can be spawned by the Roots "Summon Creatures" ritual.
