REMINDER: Iron Backpacks are being phased out. They will be removed in a later version, so move your items into Simply Backpacks.

## Mod Modifications:

- Updated AgriCraft to version 1.12.2-b2 and its dependency InfinityLib to version 1.12.1. This added world configs: Disabled AgriCraft houses there.
- Updated Extra CPUs to version 1.2.0.

## Bugfixes:

- The Crown of Skies can now actually be duplicated.
- Fixed the Roots achievement disappearing due to the Pyre having a different internal name in the new Roots version.
- The special Stone required for the TeslaCore Machine Case is no longer in the stone and stonebrick OreDicionaries.
- Fixed the Enrichment Chamber outputting Charged Certus Quartz when regular Certus Quartz Ore is input.
- Better Nether Cities no longer generate. (They could freeze up and crash the game/server.)
- Cleared the Roots and EvilCraft Loot inject tables.
- Fixed the Abyssal Wasteland and Dreadlands Necronomicons only being craftable with an empty Necronomicon.
- Fixed the Omothol Necronomicon not having its base recipe removed.
- Replaced the Puzzle Pieces Backpack with a Diamond Shulker Box, since the Holding enchantment on the previous bag could transform into something else for some reason.

## Balance Adjustments:

- The Immersive Engineering Railgun now deals 10x more damage (with all bullets), the Homing Bullet also deals an additional 2x more (20x in total). Additionally RF consumption is now only 200 RF per shot (down from 800 RF per shot).
- The Immersive Engineering Chemthrower now consumes 10x less fluid and 32x less RF/tick.
- Radiator Blocks now craft 2 at a time.
- The Unbreakable Wand now upgrades from the Diamond Wand.
- Removed Frosts (explody snow flake mobs). This removes access to Tomatoes, so instead Tomato Seeds are now rarely found in regular dungeon chests.
- The Roots Acid Cloud spell has been deemed too OP (especially with the Heal modifier), so it's been gated after Chapter 10.
- The Solar Neutron Activator now takes an Advanced Induction Cell (down from an Elite).
- Added AbyssalCraft Creation Ritual recipes for Natura Saplings: Maple, Silverbell, Amaranth, Tigerwood, Willow, Eucalyptus, Hopseed, Sakura, Redwood, Ghostwood, Fusewood, Darkwood, Bloodwood.
- Removed the Portly Gentlemen trait from Enderium items, and replaced some with Endspeed. Replaced the Portly Gentlemen trait on Fluix tools with Unnatural. (Moving entities shouldn't be available so early.)
- Gated Morbs and Reusable Morbs until Chapter 10.

## QoL Improvements:

- JEI Resources now correctly shows where ores spawn.
- Treated Leather, Energized Osmium and Energized Certus can now be crafted with a Thermal or EnderIO Tank.
- Removed the Tool Progression Magic Mushroom from JEI.

## Text and Quest Updates:

- Extended the Coralium Stone tooltip that the Cobblestone version can be found in the Abyssal Wasteland.
- Rewarded Heart Canisters in Exploration I no longer have an empty NBT tag, so they stack with already crafted ones.
- The Black Tarantula quest now correctly states "Eucalyptus tree" instead of "Baobab tree".
- Fixed a typo in the Arc Furnace quest: "on the pack" -> "on the back".
- Corrected the TeslaCore Upgrades quest: "64 of each can be used." -> "One of each of these can be used."
