REMINDER: Iron Backpacks are being phased out. They will be REMOVED in the NEXT UPDATE, so move your items into Simply Backpacks.



- Updated Roots to 1.12.2-3.1.2. This fixes the server crash with the Runic Crafter, a crash when using a Comparator on a block, and other bugs: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roots/files/3461007.
- Added the Knowledge Sharer mod, making it possible to share Thaumcraft knowledge between team members. To use, both player need to hold a Thaumonomicon, and the sharer has to right click the receiver.
- Aerogel is now craftable with Tier 1 and 2 Mystical Agriculture Essences.
- Conduit Facades now craft 4 at a time.
- IE Wires are now much less likely to burn up. (Increased their transfer rate, but this is still limited by the connector transfer rate.)
- The Sight Reagent now takes a Splash Night Vision Potion instead of an Insight III book, because enchantment IDs could get randomly shuffled on servers.
- IE Uranium and Platinum deposits are now actually correctly removed.
- The Immersive, Actually Additions, Extra Utiltiies and Lightning Crushers can now crush regular and charged Certus to Dust, and the AE2 Grindstone and the Thermal Pulverizer can now crush charged Certus as well.
- The SAG Mill can now process Gold Ores and Oil Sand Ores.
- The Creative Vending Upgrade now requires 3 Creative Capacitor Banks instead of 3 Creative Buffers, because after I've moved the Creative Buffer further, the Vending Upgrade was made uncraftable.
- Fixed a Command Block not turning into a Spawner in the Venus Dungeon.
- There is currently a bug with EnderTweaker where custom Alloy Smelter recipes that used inputs with multiple items in the same stack could be created with only 1 item in the stack. Because of this, the Resonating Orb and the Festive Ball can no longer be crafted in the Alloy Smelter, slightly altered the Dark Soularium recipe, and moved all other affected recipes from scripts to EnderIO's user_recipes.xml: Blank Dark Steel Upgrade, Snowflake, Electrotine/Red/Glowing/Cheesy Silicon Compounds, Modularium Ingot, Raw Meteoric Iron, Blutonium Ingot, Black Iron Ingot, Potentia Sphere, Materialized Vengeance Spirit, Darkened Apple, Organic Black Dye, all custom Alchemistry Compounds, Tough Galactic Plating, Crystal Bundle, all Blood Magic Runes, Demon Heart duplication recipe, Crystal Matrix Ingot, Chunk of Coralium.
- Increased the Capacity of all Mekanism Energy Cubes. (800k / 3.2M / 12.8M / 51.2M -> 4M / 12M / 36M / 108M)
- The Ring of Growth no longer requires a Roots Spell dust, as it became uncraftable in Roots 3.1.
- Added more Fossil, Temple and Gneiss Ores to Erebus.
- Fixed Pulverized Obsidian giving Molten Brass in the Magma Crucible - now it gives Lava.
- Compasses and Clocks can now the smelted in the Induction Smelter.
- The Wildwood Block now requires Manaweave Cloth instead of Spellbinding Cloth since Extended Crafting can't use IIngredientTransformers. Related: https://github.com/BlakeBr0/ExtendedCrafting/issues/126.
- The Atomic Disassembler now drops all blocks it mines.
- Added a custom recipe for the Handy Bag (Large), and moved its quest from Chapter 13 to 19.
- Rearranged the quests in Chapter 13, and the "Memory Card (items) 12 B" quest no longer requires the Ender Storage quests.
- The Necronomicon quests now accept a Necronomicon with any PE.
- Added a quest in Chapter 18, explaining the 4 remaining Blood Magic Runes.
- Fixed some typos: TEPid Brine quest: "xzy" -> "xyz" and "cube" -> "cuboid", JetPlate quests: "change" -> "charge", Magical Tablet: "fulfil" -> "fulfill".
- Fixed misinformation in the Self Sacrifice Rune quest "10% additively" -> "5% additively".
- Moved around the Capacitor quests in Chapter 4 so they're available earlier.
- Roots quests now correctly state that any kind of Elemental Soil works.
- A Flute with any NBT is now accepted in Chapter 2.
- The "What is BQ" quest now correctly describes the quest layout.
- The Excavator quest now correctly states that the consumption rate is 1024 RF/tick, not 4096.
- The Worn Stone Brick Path quest now rewards a Large Bloodstone Tile instead of 2 Demon Blood Shards (could skip progression).
  (Thank you to WaitingIdly for implementing most of these quest changes!)
- Added the Pixel Gaming server as a Featured Server.
- The Eye of the Watcher tooltip now correctly references the Call of the Watcher.
- Added a warning tooltip for the Mysterious Clock, Call of the Watcher and Horde Horn to not use them from your off-hand, as it could delete a different item in your inventory.
- Added a tooltip for the Infinity Booster Card: "Can only be crafted, is not consumed by operation."
- Corrected a loading screen tip: "Slimestring" -> "Slimesling".
