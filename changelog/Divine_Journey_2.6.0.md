REMINDER: Iron Backpacks have been removed in the previous update (2.5.0). If you still have something in them, move them to a Simply Backpack BEFORE updating.

## Mod Modifications:

- Updated Extended Crafting: OmniFactory Edition to 1.6.1.1, fixing the issue where Quantum Compressors don't work at all.
- Added the DupeFix Project, fixing a TON of potential dupes: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dupefix-project.
- Added the Simple Void World mod, changed its dimension ID to -100 (from 43, which might interfere with already created RFTools dimensions), added a custom recipe to its Portal block, and added a quest for it in Chapter 12.
- Removed Smooth Font. It's not used by default. If you were using it, you can readd it to your instance, it's a client-only mod.

## Bugfixes:

- Lumium can now be made in the Arc Furnace.
- Hardened Mithril Glass can now be made in the Induction Smelter.
- Disabled LightningCraft Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes, Hoes and Hammers. They are pretty broken, can dupe mined blocks, can randomly break, etc. Heavy Duty tools are now crafted from Cold Iron tools. Noted this in the Wyvern tool quest in Chapter 25.
- All Roots plants that could be planted on any Elemental Soil, if AgriCraftified, can now also be planted on any Elemental Soil.
- Added a custom item called "Redstone Inlay Package", because the Redstone Inlay wasn't crafting 4 at a time in regular Infusion. Now the Package is being crafted instead, which can be turned into 4 Inlays.
- For some reason the Mob Chunk recipe only works in the Pulverizer and the AE Grindstone, so removed the others for now until I can figure out how to fix this.
- Fixed Molten Cobalt casting the wrong type of Cobalt block.
- The following Seeds no longer take faint Constellations to craft, which makes them craftable: Coralium, Alumite, Elementium, Dark Steel, Fluxed Electrum, Enderman, Ghast, and everything else crafted from them.
- Nether Seeds now also spread on Crop Sticks, like all other Seeds do.
- The Enhanced Building Guide can now be crafted from a Building Guide with any NBT.
- The Black Hole Unit can now be crafted from inputs with any NBT.
- Angel Rings can now be crafted from any type of FlÃ¼gel Tiara.
- I accidentally saved a previously pregenerated version of the Skythern dungeon in 2.5.0 (the loot wasn't random and still included Knowledges of the Sky) - I fixed it now.
- Gas Storage Monitors and Gas Conversion Monitors now take a Basic Pressurized Tube instead of a Gas Level Emitter, because the latter was disabled.

## Balance Adjustments:

- All Builders Wands are now much cheaper. They're now available in Chapter 1/4/9/11/14 (instead of 9/11/13/17/18). Also moved the Destruction Wand to Chapter 9. Moved the ExtraUtils Wand quests to Chapter 9 and created a new quest in Chapter 13 for the Unbreakable Wand. Additionally, increased the durability of all (non-unbrakable) Better Builder's Wands: Stone: 130 -> 1000, Iron: 250 - > 3000, Diamond: 1561 -> 8000.
- Reenabled the Imperfect Ritual Stone night time ritual, but gated the Stone to Chapter 23. Also added a quest for it there.
- Mekanism Teleportation Cores now craft 2 at a time (up from 1).
- Binder Composite now crafts 4 at a time (up from 2).
- Molten Refined Obsidian can no longer be made from Refined Obsidian Dust (because this would skip the need for Osmium).
- Conductive Iron Seeds now take Conductive Iron instead of Manyullin (whoops).
- Reduced the transfer rate of Stellar Energy Conduits from 2 Billion RF/tick to 10,485,760 RF/tick (32x the previous tier), to make it more inline with Cryoducts.

## QoL Improvements:

- Circuit Plates can now be crafted from any Stone.
- Different types of the same Underground Biomes Ores can now be ore excavated out together.
- JEI Resources is now up-to-date for and every block in the overworld. (Huge thanks to Auti for regenerating the world-gen file!)
- Increased the spawn rate of Ghasts in the Nether, because there is barely enough space for them to spawn.
- Ctrl+Delete no longer deletes an item in the inventory (could lead to accidents).
- Hid the non-empty Morbs and Florbs from JEI, because they were really spammy.
- Moss can now be harvested from Underground Biomes Mossy Cobblestones using a Roots Knife.
- All Thaumcraft Infusions that took 250 of some Essentia now only take 240, so the Auto Infusion Matrix's slots don't steal Essentia from each other after a craft has finished.
- HOP Graphite can now be crushed in the AE2 Grindstone, Extra Utilities Crusher, SAG Mill, and Mekanism Crusher.

## Text and Quest Updates:

- Added a quest to Chapter 21 on how to automate Essentia production. Huge thanks to jehlpxyz, legendcrazyman, and ming3012 for writing it!
- Added info to the Engraver quest in Chapter 18 that it can also be found in some Omothol houses.
- Fixed misinformation in the Chapter 18 "From the depths... Rise!" quest that the Ritual is located on page 20 of the Abyssalnomicon, not 21.
- The Creative Reservoir quest in Chapter 29 now also accepts one full of Liquid Space.
- Fixed a quest not being detected and yet another typo in Chapter 30.
- Fixed some loading screen tips: "Modular Fey Crafter" -> "Runic Crafter"; corrected a tip that made it sound like every early game exploration mod is optional - not just the Twilight Forest; and "mix of Thaumcraft, Bewitchment and Astral Sorcery" -> "mix of Thaumcraft, Bewitchment and DivineRPG, all leading up to Astral Sorcery".
- Fixed a typo in the Fluxed Phyto-Gro tooltip: "Phyto-Grow" -> "Phyto-Gro".

## Texture Transformations:

- Pinfly Seeds no longer have a broken texture and are now working correctly.
