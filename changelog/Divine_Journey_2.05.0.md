## Mod Modifications:

- Added Erebus Fix, which should fix the Hwyla crashes on Preserved Blocks.
- Added FastWorkbench. The Crafting Table should no longer lag out when shift-crafting a stack of items.
- Updated B.A.S.E to 1.12.2-3.14.0, which does the exact same as ContentTweaker Registry Orderer, so the latter has been removed.

## Bugfixes:

- Actually fixed the Roots advancement not showing up.
- Fluxpack Patterns should now actually be creatable.
- The Gaia Guardian II no longer drops useless Runes.
- Enchanted Fabric now requires 4 Manaweave Cloth and 1 Mana Pearl instead of a Spellbinding Cloth, because the latter didn't get used up properly.
- Alumentum now requires the correct research ("ALUMENTUM" instead of "INFUSION").
- Fixed some bugs in the Skythern dungeon: No more Skythern Blocks are located inside, replaced most of them with Apalachia blocks. The Boss Door is no longer cheesable with an Ender Pearl. Filled in a bunch more empty space so players that happen to spawn inside don't get stuck. Knowledge of the Sky can no longer be simply found in regular chests - the player needs to now actually beat the dungeon.
- Dense and Impulse Itemducts now have their base (unchanged) recipe removed. Impulse Itemducts (Opaque) can no longer be crafted from Itemducts without using the Fluid Transposer.
- Arrows of Decay can now also use the CoFH Lingering Potions of Decay, not just the EnderIO ones, making them craftable, and also making the Withering Enchanted Books craftable.
- MysticalWorld Huts now generate with the correct type of Silver.

## Balance Adjustments:

- Reenabled the Plant Interactor and added a recipe for it.
- Added a missing custom recipe for Glass Essentia Tubes.
- Added a missing recipe for the Orechid Petallius.
- Dark Tanks can now correctly be combined even if the first one doesn't have fluid, but the second one does.
- The Pulverized Iron + Coke Dust recipe to make Steel in the Arc Furnace now actually works.
- Garden Cloches now require a Prudentium Ingot instead of an Intermedium Ingot.
- Moved Growth Infusion Liquid, Crop Sticks, the Seed Analyzer, the Gardening Trowel and the Clipper from Chapter 26 to 23 and made their recipes easier. Removed a quest in Chapter 26 the gated these.

## QoL Improvements:

- Increased Magical Forest biome weight from 20 to 45.
- Electrum, Invar, Constantan, Signalum, Lumium and Enderium Ingots can now be crushed in the Mekanism Crusher.
- Sheetmetal Slabs can now be converted back into Sheetmetal.
- Lowered Blizz spawn rate in Iceika fro 40 to 10.

## Text and Quest Updates:

- AbyssalCraft item names are no longer locked behind research.
- Fixed the Handy Bag quest not connecting and requiring the wrong item in Chapter 13. Fixed the wrong Handy Bag in Chapter 19. Also added more info into these quests.
- Added a quest for the Vis Battery in Chapter 19.
- Undid the Self-Sacrafice Rune misinformation change in Chapter 15 in the last update (the previous one was actually correct).
- Removed the Wire Cutter quest in Chapter 4 as there were many issues with it. Instead Wire Cutters are now a quest reward.
- The Skythern Key quests in Chapter 19 and the Stellar Armor quest in Chapter 20 are now always visible.
(Thank you to WaitingIdly for implementing the previous 5 quest changes!)
- Added an explanation to the Hellfire Forge and Alchemy Table in Chapter 15 on how to automate items that require multiple of the same input item. (Thank you to Bosfik for a Google Document that explains this!)
- The Wither Skeleton quest in Chapter 5 no longer requires Wither Bones.
- Draconic Evolution Crafting Injectors now default to Single Item Mode. Changed a quest description in Chapter 25 because of this.
- Added warnings to all Extra Utilities machine quests in Chapter 9 that breaking them with a Pickaxe that has "Direct" on it causes the server to crash.
- Fixed the Fluxed Thruster quest in Chapter 12 asking for a Cryotheum Coolant Unit, not a Fluxed Thruster.
- Fixed a typo in the Chapter 16 Thermal Seeds quest: "Menril" -> "Mithril".
- Fixed the Snow Queen quest in Chapter 5 giving the wrong kind of Amethyst Ore.
- Added a tooltip for the Meteorite Compass that "Meteorites can ONLY be found in Atum."

## GitHub Developments:
