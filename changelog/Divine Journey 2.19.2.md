## Bugfixes:

- Remove the final references to an "betterbuilderswands:wandunbreakable" with a damage of 0.
- Prevented a random Thaumic Augmentation boss Shield from being captureable in Soul Vials.
- Removed Bibliocraft Gold/Iron Lamp/Lantern Chisel Categories, as attempting to chisel them in-world causes a crash.
- Fix a crash involving Universal Tweaks attempting to play a sound on server start (Universal Twaeks).
- Fix a crash wherein a Vanilla Hopper placed pointing into the top half of a Thaumcraft Thaumatorium caused crashes upon being loaded (Universal Tweaks).
- Fix a crash involving clicking some bookmarked recipes (Not Enough Energistics).
- Ouroboros has been slain.

## Balance Changes:

- Actually removed the AntiCow Abyssalcraft Ritual mentioned in 2.19.0 (it was moved to be a Roots Summon Creatures Ritual).
- Add Liquid Meat as an output to the Passive Mob recipe of the Mob Loot Fabricator.
- Add a Slime recipe to the Mob Loot Fabricator, outputting all 3 Tinker's Construct Slimeballs, Vanilla Slimeballs, Aether Legacy Swet Balls, and Industrial Foregoing Pink Slime Balls.

## QoL:

- Add a startup timer to the bottom left of the startup screen. Defaults to 5 minutes, as polling indicates that is the average time for startup (Startup Timer).
- Add a hidden clearing recipe to RFTools PowerCell cards.
- Add an ownership clearing method to Blood Magic items, allowing teams to change the primary network controller (if, say, a player goes inactive or leaves) instead of having to recreate all those items.
- Add an ownership clearing method to AbyssalCraft Necronomicons. Automatically attunes itself to the player crafting it. More impactful than the Blood Magic version, as Necronomicons store specifically the player name rather than the UUID.
- Remove the Vanilla Snooper feature (Universal Tweaks).

## Text and Quest Changes:

- Switch requirement order of Immersive Engineering's Metal Press and its Molds.
- Clarify PackageAuto's Packager quest on the limitations of the Packager.
- Fix both Chapter 20's `Brrrrrrrrr... Icy!` quest and the LightningCraft Receiver & Transmitter quests requiring both items instead of either item.
- Add a note to Chapter 29's Peace Essence quest informing the player that they will eventually need 12 total.
- Fix an incorrect statement about Sparkling Aquamirines being the only option when Rock Crystals are available.
- Adjust the tip saying "any bosses more than once" to "most bosses more than once" due to needing to kill a few bosses a non-one amount of times.
- Add a hidden quest that requires "It never blinks" (Eye of Ender quest) and is required by "Get to the End already!" (the End Dimension quest) that automatically and silently completes and is named "Requires the Induction Smelter". Hopefully, this will end the frequent questions of where the "It never blinks" quest is.
- Add a tooltip to each Blood Magic Rune, informing of their effects on the Blood Altar.
- Add a tooltip to Blood Magic Runes of Capacity and Runes of Augmented Capacity that they do not combine, and that their breakpoint is 15 Runes of Augmented Capacity.
- Add a tooltip to Roots Cloud Berries, Infernal Bulbs, Dewgonia, and Stalicripes about how they can be grown on any Elemental Soil.
- Add a tooltip to Roots Baffle Cap about how they grow exactly like Vanilla Mushrooms.
- Add tooltips to each Thermal Expansion Upgrade Kit and Conversion Kit about what benefits they give.
- Add a tooltip to all Framed Drawers about what materials they have.
- Add a tooltip to all Drawers about their current max item count, including current upgrades.
- Add a tooltip to all Drawers about their currently held items.
