Version 2.1.0

YOU'LL NEED TO UPDATE YOUR QUEST BOOK BY TYPING:
/bq_admin default load
(This has to only be done once in multiplayer, by an admin.)

- Updated Forge version to the newest 1.12.2 version (forge-14.23.5.2855).
- Removed Just Enough Energistics as its functionality is already added by AE2: Trousers Edition.
- Added LagGoggles, and its dependency, TickCentral.
- Removed Phosphor, as it can cause serious chunk errors, and is no longer supported (https://github.com/jellysquid3/phosphor-forge/issues/73).
- Replaced ExtendedCrafting with the OmniFactory version that fixes a number of bugs.
- Updated XxX_MoreToolMats_XxX (a.k.a. PlusTiC), hopefully this fixes the jetpack crash.
- Massively reduced the spawn rate of all Recurrent Complex overworld structures, because they could cause cascading world lag. Also completely disabled the following structures: Big Clockwork Site, Big Pyramid, Gigantic Tree, Gigantic Tree 1, Small Clockwork Site, Statue Temple, Stone Maze Big, Temple Pyramid, Temple Pyramid 1, Veldt Bath, Wood Wall Remnants. (Existing ones won't disappear from the world.)
- Changed all puzzle tile names to lowercase, because they didn't register correctly on Linux. (Existing ones will disappear, but since they're in Chapter 30, there is no way anyone progressed that far yet.)
- Moved the Creative Buffer to be available after the Creative Chest, and the AE2 Creative Energy Cell now takes a Creative Capacitor Bank instead. Also moved around quests in Chapter 29 because of this.
- Added missing rewards for the Creative Quibit Cluster and the Creative Capacitor Bank.
- The Nether Quartz, Certus Quartz and Black Quartz Pickaxes now have mining level Iron, not Diamond.
- Fixed a grammatical error in a tip.
- The Flute quest now correctly tells the player to right click it before trying to submit it.
- Fixed the Tiny Charcoal and Fragmented Carbon recipe conflict.
- Amethyst tools now have less durability (1561 -> 600) to be more in line with Diamond tools.
- Hid some unused Planet Progression items from JEI.
- Added some water to the drop in the Eden dungeon maze section.

Version 2.1.1

- TickCentral causes a bug with EnderIO Conduits. The newest EnderIO version fixes it, but it's imcompatible with the newest EvilCraftCompat version. In short, removed LagGoggles and TickCentral for now.
