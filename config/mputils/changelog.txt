(This has to only be done once in multiplayer, by an admin.)

REMINDER: Iron Backpacks are being phased out. They will be removed NEXT UPDATE, so move your items into Simply Backpacks.

Version 2.5.0

- Removed Iron Backpacks. (It was replaced by Simply Backpacks through a slow phasing-out process due to duplication bugs.)
- Updated Applied Energistics Trouser's Edition from v45d to v47. Changelogs: https://github.com/PrototypeTrousers/Applied-Energistics-2/releases/tag/omni-fixes-v46, https://github.com/PrototypeTrousers/Applied-Energistics-2/releases/tag/omni-fixes-v47.
- Added Erebus Fix, which should fix the Hwyla crashes on Preserved Blocks.
- Added FastWorkbench. The Crafting Table should no longer lag out when shift-crafting a stack of items.
- Updated B.A.S.E to 1.12.2-3.14.0, which does the exact same as ContentTweaker Registry Orderer, so the latter has been removed.

- Actually fixed the Roots advancement not showing up.
- AbyssalCraft item names are no longer locked behind research.

- Added a missing recipe for the Orechid Petallius.
- The Gaia Guardian II no longer drops useless Runes.
- Enchanted Fabric now requires 4 Manaweave Cloth and 1 Mana Pearl instead of a Spellbinding Cloth, because the latter didn't get used up properly.
- Alumentum now requires the correct research ("ALUMENTUM" instead of "INFUSION").
- Fixed some bugs in the Skythern dungeon: No more Skythern Blocks are located inside, replaced most of them with Apalachia blocks. The Boss Door is no longer cheesable with an Ender Pearl. Filled in a bunch more empty space so players that happen to spawn inside don't get stuck. Knowledge of the Sky can no longer be simply found in regular chests - the player needs to now actually beat the dungeon.

- Sheetmetal Slabs can now be converted back into Sheetmetal.
- Arrows of Decay can now also use the CoFH Lingering Potions of Decay, not just the EnderIO ones, making them craftable, and also making the Withering Enchanted Books craftable.
- Dark Tanks can now correctly be combined even if the first one doesn't have fluid, but the second one does.
- The Pulverized Iron + Coke Dust recipe to make Steel in the Arc Furnace now actually works.
- Lowered Blizz spawn rate in Iceika fro 40 to 10.
- MysticalWorld Huts now generate with the correct type of Silver.
- Garden Cloches now require a Prudentium Ingot instead of an Intermedium Ingot.
- Moved Growth Infusion Liquid, Crop Sticks, the Seed Analyzer, the Gardening Trowel and the Clipper from Chapter 26 to 23 and made their recipes easier. Removed a quest in Chapter 26 the gated these.

- Added a quest for the Vis Battery in Chapter 19.
- Undid the Self-Sacrafice Rune misinformation change in Chapter 15 in the last update (the previous one was actually correct).
